"Context More than a century of forest and fire management of Inland Pacific landscapes has transformed their successional and disturbance dynamics. Regional connectivity of many terrestrial and aquatic habitats is fragmented, flows of some ecological and physical processes have been altered in space and time, and the frequency, size and intensity of many disturbances that configure these habitats have been altered. Current efforts to address these impacts yield a small footprint in comparison to wildfires and insect outbreaks. Moreover, many current projects emphasize thinning and fuels reduction within individual forest stands, while overlooking large-scale habitat connectivity and disturbance flow issues. Methods We provide a framework for landscape restoration, offering seven principles. We discuss their implication for management, and illustrate their application with examples. Results Historical forests were spatially heterogeneous at multiple scales. Heterogeneity was the result of variability and interactions among native ecological patterns and processes, including successional and disturbance processes regulated by climatic and topographic drivers. Native flora and fauna were adapted to these conditions, which conferred a measure of resilience to variability in climate and recurrent contagious disturbances. Conclusions To restore key characteristics of this resilience to current landscapes, planning and management are needed at ecoregion, local landscape, successional patch, and tree neighborhood scales. Restoration that works effectively across ownerships and allocations will require active thinking about landscapes as socio-ecological systems that provide services to people within the finite capacities of ecosystems. We focus attention on landscape-level prescriptions as foundational to restoration planning and execution."
"Context The ability of landscapes to impede species' movement or gene flow may be quantified by resistance models. Few studies have assessed the performance of resistance models parameterized by expert opinion. In addition, resistance models differ in terms of spatial and thematic resolution as well as their focus on the ecology of a particular species or more generally on the degree of human modification of the landscape (i.e. landscape integrity). The effect of these design decisions on model accuracy is poorly understood. Objectives We sought to understand the influence of expert parameterization, resolution, and specificity (i.e. species-specific or landscape integrity) on the fit of resistance model predictions to empirical landscape patterns. Methods With genetic and observational data collected from Greater Sage-Grouse (Centrocercus urophasianus) in Washington State, USA, we used landscape genetic analysis and logistic regression to evaluate a range of resistance models in terms of their ability to predict empirical patterns of genetic differentiation and lek occupancy. Results We found that species-specific, fine resolution resistance models generally had stronger relationships to empirical patterns than coarse resolution or landscape integrity models, and that the expert models were less predictive than alternative parameterizations. Conclusions Our study offers an empirical framework to validate expert resistance models, suggests the need to match the grain of the data to the scale at which the species responds to landscape heterogeneity, and underscores the limitations of landscape integrity models when the species under study does not meet their assumptions."
"Context Land use changes and intensification have been amongst the major causes of the on-going biodiversity decline in Europe. A better understanding and description of how different levels of land use intensity affect biodiversity can support the planning and evaluation of policy measures. Objectives Our study investigates how land use-related landscape characteristics affect bird diversity, considering different spatial scales and species groups with characteristic habitat use. Methods We used breeding bird census data from 2693 observation points along 206 transects and applied a random effects hurdle model to describe the influence of the landscape characteristics altitude, forest proportion, patch density, land cover diversity, and land use intensity on avian species richness. Results Land use intensity and related landscape characteristics formed an important explanatory variable for bird richness. Increasing land use intensity was accompanied by a decrease in bird species richness. While forest bird richness decreased with a decreasing amount of forest cover, farmland species richness increased. This led to a bird diversity peak in extensively used semi-open landscapes. The influence of land cover diversity on species richness was small. Increasing patch density had positive effects on forest birds, but affected farm birds negatively. The strongest correlation between land use-based indicators and bird diversity was determined using spatial indicators at a close range around observation points (100-500 m radius). Conclusions Our results assist interpretation of the Pan-European Common Bird Indices and emphasize the importance of using multifaceted and thoroughly selected indicators in the context of biodiversity monitoring and decision-making support."
"Context Functional connectivity-the facilitation of individual movements among habitat patches-is essential for species' persistence in fragmented landscapes. Evaluating functional connectivity is critical for predicting range shifts, developing conservation plans, and anticipating effects of disturbance, especially for species affected by climate change. Objectives We examined whether simplifying forest structure influenced animal movements and whether an experimental approach to quantifying functional connectivity reflects normal behavior, which is often assumed but remains untested. Methods We evaluated functional connectivity for Pacific marten (Martes caurina) across a gradient in forest structural complexity using two novel methods for this species: incentivized food-titration experiments and non-incentivized locations collected via GPS telemetry (24 individuals). Results Food titration experiments revealed martens selected complex stands, and martens entered and crossed areas with reduced forest cover when motivated by bait, particularly in the winter. However, our telemetry data showed that without such incentive, martens avoided openings and simple stands and selected complex forest stands equally during summer and winter. Conclusions Detections at baited stations may not represent typical habitat preferences during winter, and incentivized experiments reflect the capacity of martens to enter non-preferred stand types under high motivation (e.g., hunger, curiosity, dispersal). We hypothesize snow cover facilitates connectivity across openings when such motivation is present; thus, snow cover may benefit dispersing animals and increase population connectivity. Landscapes with joined networks of complex stands are crucial for maintaining functional connectivity for marten, particularly during summer."
"Context Tree species distribution and abundance are affected by forces operating across a hierarchy of ecological scales. Process and species distribution models have been developed emphasizing forces at different scales. Understanding model agreement across hierarchical scales provides perspective on prediction uncertainty and ultimately enables policy makers and managers to make better decisions. Objective Our objective was to test the hypothesis that agreement between process and species distribution models varies by hierarchical level. Due to the top-down approach of species distribution models and the bottom-up approach of process models, the most agreement will occur at the mid-level of the hierarchical analysis, the ecological subsection level, capturing the effects of soil variables. Methods We compared projections of a species distribution model, Climate Change Tree Atlas, and a process model, LINKAGES 2.2. We conducted a correlation analysis between the models at regional, ecological subsection, and species level hierarchical scales. Results Both models had significant positive correlation (rho = 0.53, P < 0.001) on the regional scale. The majority of the ecological subsections had greater model correlation than on the regional level when all climate scenarios were pooled. Correlation was poorest for the analysis of individual species. Models had the greatest correlation at the regional scale for the GFDL-A1fi scenario (the scenario with the most climate change). Species near their range edge generally had stronger correlation (loblolly pine, northern red oak, black oak). Conclusion Our general hypothesis was partly accepted. This suggests that uncertainties are relatively low when interpreting model results at subsection level."
"Strong reciprocal interactions exist between landscape patterns and ecological processes. In wetlands, hydrology is the dominant abiotic driver of ecological processes and both controls, and is controlled, by vegetation presence and patterning. We focus on binary patterning in the Everglades ridge-slough landscape, where longitudinally connected flow, principally in sloughs, is integral to landscape function. Patterning controls discharge competence in this low-gradient peatland, with important feedbacks on hydroperiod and thus peat accretion and patch transitions. To quantitatively predict pattern effects on hydrologic connectivity and thus hydroperiod. We evaluated three pattern metrics that vary in their hydrologic specificity. (1) Landscape discharge competence considers elongation and patch-type density that capture geostatistical landscape features. (2) Directional connectivity index (DCI) extracts both flow path and direction based on graph theory. (3) Least flow cost (LFC) is based on a global spatial distance algorithm strongly analogous to landscape water routing, where ridges have higher flow cost than sloughs because of their elevation and vegetation structure. Metrics were evaluated in comparison to hydroperiod estimated using a numerically intensive hydrologic model for synthetic landscapes. Fitted relationships between metrics and hydroperiod for synthetic landscapes were extrapolated to contemporary and historical maps to explore hydroperiod trends in space and time. Both LFC and DCI were excellent predictors of hydroperiod and useful for diagnosing how the modern landscape has reorganized in response to modified hydrology. Metric simplicity and performance indicates potential to provide hydrologically explicit, computationally simple, and spatially independent predictions of landscape hydrology, and thus effectively measure of restoration performance."
"Forest management alters patterns generated by natural disturbances, particularly in ecosystems with infrequent fires. Management effects can differ according to spatial scale and affect ecological processes. To assess the effect of 80 years of forest management at both the landscape and burn/harvest scales on forest age, composition, density, spatial pattern and heterogeneity. Forest inventory maps and satellite images were used to compare two contiguous landscapes, respectively managed and unmanaged, of the eastern boreal forest of Canada, in a region with infrequent fires. Burns and harvests occurring from 1920-1950 were also compared. In addition to reducing the proportion of old-growth stands in the landscape, forest management changed forest composition at both scales, favouring the late-successional species balsam fir. Landscape metrics indicated that old-growth forests and spruce-dominated ones were more fragmented, less connected, and confined to smaller patches in the managed landscape than in the unmanaged one. Forest management increased heterogeneity at the landscape scale, but decreased it at the burn/harvest scale. Logging had a homogenizing effect at the burn/harvest scale by attenuating the effect of the physical environment on forest density. This study provides knowledge to help reduce effects of forest management at both scales. In this forest region with low fire recurrence, the goal should be to manage for greater forest heterogeneity at the burn/harvest scale whereas, at the landscape scale, restoration strategies should aim to create large contiguous patches of coniferous forests to increase spatial continuity as these were reduced by past management activities."
"Species distributions are influenced by habitat conditions and ecological processes at multiple spatial scales. An understanding of the importance of habitat characteristics at different spatial scales is important when developing biodiversity conservation measures. We investigated the effect of habitat characteristics or amount at three spatial scales on the occurrence of saproxylic (=dead wood-dependent) beetles. Saproxylic beetles were sampled under the bark of dead wood in a managed forest landscape in central Sweden. We modelled the occurrence probability in dead wood items of 44 species (all species occurring in > 2 % of the items), based on dead wood item characteristics, forest stand characteristics, and habitat connectivity (i.e. area of potentially suitable forest stands in the surrounding of each stand), using hierarchical Bayesian regression. For the majority of species, dead wood item characteristics (especially tree species and whether standing or downed) were more important than measured stand characteristics and habitat connectivity. Whether the stands were clear-cuts, mature forests, or reserves affected some species, whereas the stand-level amount of dead wood per hectare was not important for any species. Habitat connectivity improved the occurrence models for about a half of the species, but there were both positive and negative relationships, and they were generally weak. Forest management should include creation and retention of a high diversity of dead wood to sustain habitat for all species. In a forest-dominated landscape, the spatial distribution of dead wood is of little importance for common saproxylic beetle species."
"Wildfire is a particular concern in the wildland-urban interface (WUI) of the western United States where human development occurs close to flammable natural vegetation. (1) Assess the relative influences of WUI expansion versus climate-driven fire regime change on spatial and temporal patterns of burned WUI, and (2) determine whether WUI developed in the future will have higher or lower wildfire risk than existing WUI. We projected the spatial pattern of the WUI and its associated wildfire risk from 2005 to 2050 at 90-m spatial resolution and 5-year intervals in Colorado Front Range using CHANGE, a landscape change model that simulates land cover and land use change, natural vegetation dynamics, and wildfire in a unified framework. A total of four scenarios from a factorial design with static versus changing WUI and static versus changing fire regimes were simulated to examine the effects of WUI expansion and climate-driven fire regime change on burned area in the WUI. Both WUI expansion and fire regime change contributed to the increase of burned WUI, but fire regime change had a stronger influence. The effects of WUI expansion and fire regime change had a combined influence greater than the sum of their individual effects. This interaction was a result of projected WUI expansion into regions of higher wildfire risk than existing WUI. The human footprint will continue to expand into wildland areas and must be considered along with climate effects when assessing the impacts of changing fire regimes in future landscapes."
"When climate changes, species' distributions may either shift spatially or expand/contract around continuously-occupied refugia, altering the effectiveness of previously-fixed conservation reserve networks. We characterise the nature of climate-induced changes in species' distributions and the extent of protected habitat, using a topographically diverse, subtropical case-study region. Bioclimatic species' distribution models were developed for 13 representative forest-dependent species spanning four vertebrate classes. We used a fine-scale 0.25 km grid with nine environmental and eight climatic predictor variables, selected for biological and land-use realism and statistical independence. Downscaled climate data for future climate regimes were quantified from regional climate data together with the IPCC A1FI predictions for 2040 and 2090. Range limits and centroids of individual species' modelled habitat areas changed little between present (2000) and future climates. However the total amount of suitable habitat shrank within the initial range limits. Species with the greatest habitat reductions had the smallest proportions of their present habitat areas in refugia (habitat areas suitable under present and future climates), but the largest proportions of their future habitat areas. The absolute areas of species' habitat protected by legislation decreased, whereas the proportions that were protected changed little. Regional-scale climate change is likely to cause substantial species declines, together with reduced areas of protected suitable habitat. The observed nature of distributional change indicates that long-term regional species conservation will depend more on identifying, protecting, and restoring habitat refugia than on actions to facilitate larger-scale movements."
"In patchy environments, such as agricultural landscapes, both spatial and temporal scales of habitat heterogeneity can affect population dynamics and trophic interactions. As a result of crop rotation, landscapes and local resource availability may change dramatically within and between years. We used a tritrophic interaction constituted by pollen beetles, their host plant oilseed rape, and their parasitoids, as a model system to investigate how the effect of landscape composition on insect abundance changes with time and whether system dynamics showed carry-over effects of previous years. We employ path analysis models that allow us to study whole networks of hypotheses rather than univariate cause-effect relationships. We exposed pan traps in a 5 x 5 grid design within 10 landscapes in June 2011 (after oilseed rape flowering) and May 2012 (at peak oilseed rape flowering). Additionally, we assessed parasitism rates of pollen beetle larvae in May 2011 and measured changes in landscape composition. The effect of the oilseed rape proportion on beetle abundance changed with time from negative (during flowering) to positive (after flowering). Parasitism had a negative effect on the number of newly emerged pollen beetles, but only in landscapes with a low proportion of oilseed rape. Interestingly, our path analysis showed that landscape composition affected herbivore abundance 1 or 2 years later, mediated by changes in parasitism. Our results suggest that plant-herbivore-parasitoid interactions in dynamic agricultural landscapes can show interannual carry-over effects, as they are affected by landscape composition and top-down effects in previous years."
"Expansion of bioenergy production is part of a global effort to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and mitigate climate change. Dedicated biomass crops will compete with other land uses as most high quality arable land is already used for agriculture, urban development, and biodiversity conservation. First, we explore the trade-offs between converting land enrolled in the U.S. Conservation Reserve Program (CRP) to switchgrass for biofuel production or preserving it for biodiversity. Next, we examine the trade-offs between agriculture, biodiversity, and biofuel across the central and eastern U.S. We compiled measures of biodiversity, agriculture, and biofuel from land cover classifications, species range maps, and mechanistic model output of switchgrass yield. We used a spatially-explicit optimization algorithm to analyze the impacts of small-to-large scale biomass production by identifying locations that maximize biofuel produced from switchgrass and minimize negative impacts on biodiversity and agriculture. Using CRP land for switchgrass production increases the land area required to meet biomass goals and the species range area altered for birds, amphibians, mammals, and reptiles. When conversion is not limited to CRP, conversion scenarios including biodiversity and agriculture trade-offs require greater than 100 % more area for switchgrass to reach the same production goals. When land conversion scenarios do not include biodiversity, twice the range area for reptiles and amphibians could be altered. Land-use trade-offs between biofuel production, agriculture, and biodiversity exist and alter optimum location of land conversion for low-to-high biofuel levels. This highlights the need for systematic land-use planning for the future."
"Habitat heterogeneity is often assumed to benefit farmland biodiversity. Increasing heterogeneity of non-crop habitats is often too costly in terms of agricultural production. It has been suggested that increased crop heterogeneity could mitigate the negative effects of intensification on biodiversity while still maintaining high production levels. We investigated if habitat-specific species pools of two groups of farmland birds, field-nesting and non-crop-nesting species, were related to landscape-level heterogeneity of crop and non-crop cover. We analysed total number of species (gamma diversity) and average local species richness (alpha diversity) in landscapes and related these two biodiversity measures to four components of landscape heterogeneity (compositional and configurational heterogeneity of crop and non-crop cover). We selected 30 farmland landscapes (each 25 km(2)) in Sweden that largely broke up correlated relationships between crop and non-crop heterogeneity and between compositional and configurational heterogeneity. Estimates of species richness (alpha and gamma diversity) were calculated with bird survey data from specific habitats within landscapes (farmsteads and arable fields) and then related to measures of landscape heterogeneity. No measure of landscape species richness was associated with landscape-scale crop cover heterogeneities. However, gamma diversity of both bird groups was negatively related to the compositional and configurational heterogeneity of non-crop land-use in the landscapes, respectively. Our results suggest that: (i) crop heterogeneities are not related to habitat-specific richness of farmland birds, (ii) heterogeneity effects of habitat complementarity in general are weak and (iii) relationships between diversity and heterogeneity in landscapes are dependent on the biodiversity measure used."
"Bat conservation in the eastern United States faces threats from white nose syndrome, wind energy, and fragmentation of habitat. To mitigate population declines, the habitat requirements of species of concern must be established. Assessments that predict habitat quality based upon landscape features can aid species management over large areas. Roosts are critical habitat for many bat species including the endangered Indiana bat (Myotis sodalis) and the threatened northern long-eared bat (M. septentrionalis). While much is known about the microhabitat requirements of roosts, translating such knowledge into landscape-level management is difficult. Our goal was to determine the landscape-scale environmental variables necessary to predict roost occupancy for both species. Using MaxLike, a presence-only occupancy modeling approach, with known roost sites, we identified factors associated with roosting habitat. Spatially independent roost locations were particularly limited for northern long-eared bats resulting in differences in study areas and sample sizes between the two species. Occupancy of Indiana bat roosts was greatest in areas with > 80 % local forest cover within broader landscapes (1 km) with < 40 % forest, < 1 km of perennial streams but > 1 km from intermittent streams and in areas with poor foraging habitat. Northern long-eared roost occupancy was greatest in areas with > 80 % regional but fragmented forest cover with greater forest edge approximately 4 km from the nearest major road. Landscape features associated with roost occupancy differed greatly between species suggesting disparate roosting needs at the landscape scale, which may require independent management of roost habitat for each species."
"Climate change may amplify the effects of land-use change, including induced changes in interspecific interactions. To investigate whether an avifauna changed over a period of severe drought, and if changes in avifaunas were related to changes in vegetation characteristics and the irruption of a despotic native species, the noisy miner Manorina melanocephala. In the box-ironbark forests of south-eastern Australia, we resurveyed the avifaunas and remeasured vegetation characteristics in 120 forest transects in 2010-2011 that had previously been measured in 1995-1997. The avifauna changed markedly over the prolonged drought, and changes were more marked in smaller fragments of remnant vegetation in which more pronounced vegetation change had occurred. The noisy miner increased differentially in smaller remnants adding to the declines, especially for small-bodied birds. Long droughts interspersed with short wet periods are projected for the region, so the imposition of climate effects on an already much-modified region has profound implications for the avifauna. The noisy miner has (and continues) to benefit from both land-use and climate change, so future sequences of drought interspersed with short wet periods are likely to lead to further changes in the avifauna as the miner extends its occupancy. Differential reductions in small nectarivores and insectivores will affect ecosystem processes, including the control of defoliating insects, seed dispersal and pollination."
"Landscape-scale research quantifying ecological connectivity is required to maintain the viability of populations in dynamic environments increasingly impacted by anthropogenic modification and environmental change. To evaluate how surface water network structure, landscape resistance to movement, and flooding affect the connectivity of amphibian habitats within the Murray-Darling Basin (MDB), a highly modified but ecologically significant region of south-eastern Australia. We evaluated potential connectivity network graphs based on circuit theory, Euclidean and least-cost path distances for two amphibian species with different dispersal abilities, and used graph theory metrics to compare regional- and patch-scale connectivity across a range of flooding scenarios. Circuit theory graphs were more connected than Euclidean and least-cost equivalents in floodplain environments, and less connected in highly modified or semi-arid regions. Habitat networks were highly fragmented for both species, with flooding playing a crucial role in facilitating landscape-scale connectivity. Both formally and informally protected habitats were more likely to form important connectivity ""hubs"" or ""stepping stones"" compared to non-protected habitats, and increased in importance with flooding. Surface water network structure and the quality of the intervening landscape matrix combine to affect the connectivity of MDB amphibian habitats in ways which vary spatially and in response to flooding. Our findings highlight the importance of utilising organism-relevant connectivity models which incorporate landscape resistance to movement, and accounting for dynamic landscape-scale processes such as flooding when quantifying connectivity to inform the conservation of dynamic and highly modified environments."
"Loss of natural habitat can isolate pollinator populations and negatively affect sexual reproduction of animal-pollinated plants. We evaluated how the loss of natural forest affects pollinator diversity in the understory of the Atlantic Rainforest in Northeastern Brazil. We focused on bees, the main group of pollinators for angiosperms. We assessed how changes in forest cover at regional (36 km(2)) and local (0.36 km(2)) scales affect bee richness and abundance. We sampled 492 bees from 59 species, of which 58 % were above ground nesting species and 73 % exhibited some level of sociality. Our results show that the loss of forest had negative effects on understory bee abundance, which was particularly accentuated for species that nest above ground. However, for social bees the effect of changes in forest cover at a local scale depended on regional forest cover, negative effects being only detected when landscapes had at least 35 % of forest. For bee richness, the null model was among the best models bringing considerable uncertainty about landscape effects on bee richness. These findings suggest that management strategies and conservation practices must integrate proper actions that consider both local and regional scales. For existing fragmented landscapes, it is important to increase forest availability at the regional scale, while also maintaining high environmental heterogeneity at the local scale. We believe that with proper landscape planning this multiscalar approach can be not only more effective, but also easier to implement."
"Patch use can illustrate the contributions that forage quality and foraging risk make in shaping foraging decisions made under the risk of being killed. We aimed to determine whether forage selection by European bison Bison bonasus was state-dependent in being shaped by risk (wolf predation or human poaching/culling avoidance) or nutrient quality at two time periods-early winter (when resources are abundant) and at the end of winter (when resources are scarce)-in BiaowieA1/4a Primeval Forest (Poland). We used a giving-up density framework using the proportional consumption of hay provided by humans to measure the perceptions of risk in European bison. European bison resource selection was primarily driven by minimising the distance they travel over open ground in early winter (i.e. avoiding humans), however by the end of winter, when resources are scarce, bison selected haystacks for their nutrient quality (low fibre, high Mg and energy). This study illustrates how resource selection varies according to the condition of animals (i.e. state-dependency affects the marginal value theorem). It also indicates conservation managers using hay quality may actively manage human-bison conflicts in trouble spots and that bison are currently free from top-down limitation in BiaowieA1/4a as they do not perceive wolves as threatening enough to alter their foraging behaviour."
"Land-use change is a global phenomenon with potential to generate abrupt spatial changes in species' distributions. We assessed whether theory about the internal structure of bird species' geographic ranges can be refined to reflect abrupt changes in distribution and abundance associated with human influences on landscapes, and whether the prevalence and diversity of bird-landscape threshold relationships may significantly complicate assemblage-level avian conservation. For three large regions in the United States, we used the North American Breeding Bird Survey, U.S. National Land Cover Data, and multivariate adaptive regression splines to assess whether land bird species' abundances were associated with landscape composition and configuration in a threshold fashion. Threshold relationships between abundance and landscape characteristics were exhibited by 42-60 % of the species studied. The relationships were evident for five land types and five habitat guilds. We observed threshold relationships for more taxonomically diverse groups of bird species, a broader set of land types, and larger geographic extents than have been considered to date. Avian distribution and abundance theory can be refined by articulating that characteristics of human-altered landscapes have the potential to be widespread and biologically important contributors to abrupt spatial change in species' abundances. Our findings also expose bird-landscape threshold relationships as pervasive and diverse patterns that impose a much more complicated set of circumstances for assemblage-level conservation of birds than has been widely recognized. To cope with these complications, landscape planners and managers can use optimization analyses, multispecies frameworks, regulatory limits, and multivariate change-point analyses."
"Factors influencing the early stages of biological invasions, especially how the outbreak conditions project to later patterns of organism spread, is an important but rarely studied aspect of invasion biology. Our objectives were to determine whether a simple function relates outbreak disease levels and end epidemic magnitude for wheat stripe rust and to evaluate the potential role of propagule pressure. We superimposed data from experimentally initiated wheat stripe rust outbreaks (disease levels ranging from 0.01 to 30 % of the wheat host) in central Oregon, USA on the function relating disease outbreak prevalence to end epidemic magnitude in the simulation program EPIMUL. We also used EPIMUL to assess an alternative hypothesis that wheat stripe rust spread is driven by outbreak area, not propagule number, by varying outbreak area and holding the outbreak disease levels constant. A simple power function related outbreak disease levels to end epidemic magnitude and expanse of spread for wheat stripe rust in simulations. When this function was superimposed on field data, there was a tolerable alignment. Simulations suggested that end epidemic magnitude and expanse of disease spread is influenced more by changes in outbreak disease levels than outbreak area. The landscape spread of disease epidemics may be projected and reconstructed by the application of a simple power function with outbreak disease levels. Moreover, this relationship may be a useful starting point for projecting and reconstructing the patterns of biological invasions for r-selected species with long-distance dispersal."
"The dual threats of habitat fragmentation and climate change have led to a proliferation of approaches for connectivity conservation planning. Corridor analyses have traditionally taken a focal species approach, but the landscape ""naturalness"" approach of modeling connectivity among areas of low human modification has gained popularity as a less analytically intensive alternative. We compared focal species and naturalness-based corridor networks to ask whether they identify similar areas, whether a naturalness-based approach is in fact more analytically efficient, and whether agreement between the two approaches varies with focal species vagility. We compared focal-species and naturalness-based connectivity models at two nested spatial extents: greater Washington State, USA, and, within it, the Columbia Plateau ecoregion. We assessed complementarity between the two approaches by examining the spatial overlap of predicted corridors, and regressing organism traits against the amount of modeled corridor overlap. A single naturalness-based corridor network represented connectivity for a large (> 10) number of focal species as effectively as a group of between 3 and 4 randomly selected focal species. The naturalness-based approach showed only moderate spatial agreement with composite corridor networks for large numbers of focal species, and better agreed with corridor networks of large-bodied, far-dispersing species in the larger scale analysis. Naturalness-based corridor models may offer an efficient proxy for focal species models, but a multi-focal species approach may better represent the movement needs of diverse taxa. Consideration of trade-offs between the two approaches may enhance the effectiveness of their application to connectivity conservation planning."
"Determining regional and local processes that govern the maintenance of biodiversity and assessing their relative importance remain major research challenges in landscape ecology. In riparian systems, propagule dispersal and disturbance are constrained by longitudinal and lateral water flows, but riparian forests in temperate human-dominated landscapes have received little attention so far. We investigated how the longitudinal position along the river course and the lateral position to the riverbed structure forest plant communities subjected to flooding. We studied vegetation, soil seed bank, hydrochorous seed rain and environmental conditions along 23 transects perpendicular to the river in two forest floodplains in the North of France. We used generalized linear mixed models to assess the relative importance of longitudinal distance, relative elevation, and their interaction on both species richness in a given compartment and species turnover between compartments. Relative elevation to the riverbed was the main factor explaining species richness of vegetation and water seed deposit, but not of the seed bank. Vegetation was the most species-rich at low elevations, where the number of water-dispersed seeds and related species richness were maximal. The longitudinal position within the riparian forest had no effect on vegetation and seed bank richness. Dissimilarity between the seed bank and the seed rain increased with relative elevation. Lateral much more than longitudinal movements of water create a strong gradient in seed rain intensity that structures plant communities. Flooding is important to species dispersal, hence to the conservation of species-rich plant communities within human-pressured landscapes."
"Unveiling the scale at which organisms respond to habitat features is crucial to understand how they are influenced by anthropogenic environmental changes. We implemented species distribution models (SDMs) based on multiple-scale landscape pattern analysis for four bat species representative of different foraging guilds: Nyctalus leisleri, Rhinolophus hipposideros, Myotis emarginatus and Pipistrellus pipistrellus. (a) to assess the environmental factors and the influence of scale on the habitat suitability of bats; (b) to develop an objective methodology to select the best performing variables from a large variable dataset. We performed the study in central Italy (Tuscany): 381 variables were derived from topographical and habitat maps using a moving windows analysis set at three spatial scales (1, 5 and 10 km) that are ecologically meaningful for bats. For each species, we ran 381 univariate models to select the variables for multivariate SDMs. All the variables retained in the SDMs described spatial pattern indices underlining the importance of landscape structure for species distribution. Species reacted differently in terms of both scale and landscape pattern. P. pipistrellus only responded to variables at 10 km; N. leisleri and M. emarginatus did so at two scales (5 and 10 km); whereas R. hipposideros also responded to variables at 1 km. Our findings make it possible to tailor SDMs according to species-specific landscape pattern requirements at appropriate scales. Our approach, which can be easily extended to other taxa and different spatial scales, represents a significant step towards more effective land management planning."
"Spatially heterogeneous habitats often promote woody plant species and functional diversity (FD). Ungulate herbivory can have the opposite effect. Across the globe, the type and intensity of herbivory is changing, as domestic livestock replace wild ungulates, which are increasingly confined to protected areas. Despite recognition of the importance of FD for ecosystem functioning, the interactive effect of soil-related fine-scale heterogeneity and larger-scale ungulate herbivory on woody plant FD is little-known. In miombo woodland of Zimbabwe, we investigated (1) how bottom-up fine-scale heterogeneity created by Macrotermes termitaria interacts with top-down effects of herbivore foraging-guilds on woody plant FD; and (2) whether browsing combined with grazing impacts FD more than grazing alone. The three different herbivore treatments (grazing, combined browsing-and-grazing, and exclusion) had been maintained for 50 years. We surveyed 10 termite mound-matrix plots within three sites per treatment. We assessed woody plant traits and FD across treatments (herbivore feeding-guild) and position (mound or woodland-matrix), and interactive effects between these. Woody plant FD was greater on mounds, and lowest overall with browsing-and-grazing. Specific traits were associated with position (e.g. palatability was greater for mounds), and treatment (e.g. spinescence increased with grazing). Long-term enclosure of ungulate herbivores (browsing-and-grazing, and grazing alone) decreased woody FD, but this was mitigated by termitaria. The novel finding is that at regional scales, mounds can enhance woody plant FD despite the impacts of herbivory. At broader scales encompassing the miombo system, potential exists for mounds to stabilise woody plant FD from livestock-induced impacts."
"In this paper, activated carbon prepared by chemical activation based on dye sludge was used to treat dye wastewater to remove dye wastewater COD. Experiments with KOH and H3PO4 treated the original activated sludge, and set adding fly ash activated sludge as the control group. COD removal experiment results showed that: KOH as activator, the activation temperature and activation time is 60 min at 600 conditions activated sludge obtained with relative maximum iodine value, and when the adsorption time in 15 min similar to 20 min time, COD removal rate could reach above 95%. Under the same conditions, raw sludge directly activated sludge pyrolysis also has good COD removal; the best removal rate is up to 90%. The experimental results of COD removal of activated carbon in the fly ash added after the original sludge pyrolysis obtained showed that the addition of fly ash to COD removal did not play a synergistic effect. This work provided a simple and eco-friendly method for dye wastewater treatment with recycling of waste."
"The article introduces a new model of port financing - PPP (Public-Private Partnership) financing model the analysis of the model's characteristics, then expounds the confirmation of concession period through game theory, and finally discusses the obstacle of private capitals and the role of government in putting forward the prospect of PPP model in ports of China. It provides a certain theoretical basis and shows the practical significance in the application of the PPP financing model in the field of port construction."
"The water resource of the Tarim River Basin is supplied by various water sources such as precipitation, melt water of glacier and snow and it is sensitive to climatic change. The water resource system is greatly unstable and vulnerable, and its evolution law is complicated. Due to the double influence of climate change and human activities, the managerial risk and uncertainty of water resource in the Tarim River Basin are increased severely. Based on hydrological and meteorological materials of hydrological station and watershed weather station controlled in the main exits of three origins in the Tarim River Basin from 1962 to 2007, together with the materials of accumulation of snow from 2000 to 2011, its runoff changing process and its long-term tendency are analyzed by means of the linear tendency estimation method. Then, the multi-COPULA joint distribution model between meteorological and hydrological variables is established. The evolutionary driving force of water resource systems in different periods and its change of dependent measure is analyzed based on change-point detection of dependent structure and the result of the correlative degree in the tail. Temporal and spatial variation of evolution is further investigated to provide a reliable basis for regional management of water resource."

"The latest satellite altimetry data of TOPEX/Poseidon (T/P), Jason-1 and Jason-2 during the formation flight phase were analyzed. The average difference of sea level anomaly (SLA) was 9.72cm between Jason-1 and T/P, and -11.03 cm between Jason-2 and Jason-1 over the China seas and neighboring ocean. Then SLA time series from 1993 to 2012 were constructed and analyzed with the least squares method. In China seas and neighboring ocean, the average rising rate of sea surface height was about 4.64 mm/yr. The specific average rising rates were 4.44 mm/yr, 2.34 mm/yr, 3.02 mm/yr and 4.25 mm/yr in Bohai Sea, Yellow Sea, East China Sea and South China Sea, respectively. The cycles of sea level changes were also analyzed with wavelet analysis, and results showed that the most significant period of sea level change over each sea was 1 year. A quasi-nine-year cycle was also found over the South China Sea."
"This study addresses dynamic positioning technology of deepwater FPSO moored to the seabed via a turret based spread mooring system, referred to as Position Mooring (PM). In normal weather conditions, the mooring system constrains the FPSO to the predefined region. In extreme seas, however, the mooring system behaves in a limited fashion to constrain the position such that the thruster force is also needed in order to avoid damage to the mooring lines. A controller based on structural reliability is presented for turret-moored FPSO. First, a mathematical model of FPSO in terms of the kinematics and dynamics and the environmental disturbance is established. Second, a mathematical model of one single mooring line is set up based on the catenary equation. Thereafter, the mathematical model for the whole turret mooring system is established. Third, a PID and a state feedback controller based on structural reliability are designed to ensure mooring lines safety. Finally, a series of simulation tests are carried out for a turret-moored FPSO. The simulation results show that the dynamic tension of the mooring line is effectively reduced due to introduction of a reliability index in terms of controller design."
"With the development of bulk port automation, the ship loader as the main quayside machine of bulk terminal is required for transformation from manual operation to automation. The ship identification method is a key inspection technique for automated ship loaders. In this paper, a fast ship identification algorithm was formulated based on the 3D point cloud of the ship, as generated by the Laser Measurement Systems (LMS) mounted on the ship loader. To meet the requirement of real-time computing for the automated ship loader, the 3D point cloud was first processed to reduce its dimensions from 3D point cloud into a 2D image. A projection method was then applied to locate and identify all bulk cargo holds in the ship. Finally, a group of experiments on ship identification was conducted using this algorithm in the Coal Terminal of Tianjin Port. The results showed that the computing time for a whole ship was lower than 200 ms and the error of the algorithm was lower than 10%, meeting the requirement of automated ship loaders."
"A new technique called geotextile mattress with floating curtain (GMFC) may be an advisable alternative countermeasure against seabed erosion, since it can allow deposited sediment dunes to form naturally at upstream and downstream sides of GMFC when installed in erosive flow. However, cyclic loading of wave actions can lead to liquefaction of the seabed under the mattress, reducing the maximum friction resistance of the mattress, even leading to instability of the GMFC structure. Thus, in this study a series of physical model tests in a rectangular flume were carried out to investigate the behavior of a single GMFC and the hydrodynamic environment around GMFC subjected to wave loading. The wave force on seabed was recorded by pressure gauges installed on the flume bed. Experimental results indicated that some area of the unmovable bed around GMFC suffered much higher hydrodynamic pressure under the wave action. The areas directly facing the bottom openings of GMFC are more prone to bear higher cyclic force of wave actions. Moreover, the results also illustrated that the highest cyclic force of wave actions on the seabed appears at a distance of the mattress-curtain height to the GMFC centerline. The parametric study indicated that the opening ratio has a significant impact on the wave force properties."
"The spatio-temporal variability of sea level in the East China Sea (ECS) was investigated based on satellite altimeter data and tide gauge data. The sea level in the ECS has strong seasonal variations, being highest in autumn and lowest in spring. The seasonal variability is also highly variable in space. Affected by the East Asian monsoon, the sea level is higher in the north than that in the south, with its peak located near the Yangtze River estuary, especially in summer and autumn. In the past 50 years, the rate of the sea level rise near the Yangtze River Delta has been 5.45 mm/a, 1.5 times as high as the mean rate of the ECS. Therefore, the Yangtze River Delta, especially the Shanghai region, is more vulnerable to sea level rise in September and October. Monthly peak rate of the ECS is higher than the corresponding monthly average rate, with the biggest differences in March, April and October. The annual peak rate of ECS in autumn is 5.07mm/a, 1.4 times greater than the annual average rate, so more emphasis should be paid to the study of the sea-level peak to reduce the risk in coastal areas. Sea level change of the ECS has multi-scale cycle characteristics, where the annual sea level cycle is influenced by the runoff of Yangtze River and Kuroshio, while the seasonal variation characteristics are caused by strong seasonal change in sea level variation. The 30-month cycle is related to quail-biennial oscillation (QBO), the 134-month (about 11 years) cycle is the same as the sunspot activity cycle, and the 230-month (about 19 years) cycle corresponds to the moon's declination cycle (18.6 years). In the next decade, the sea level of the ECS is expected to continuously rise. We predicted that the next sea level peak period in the ECS will be around 2025."
"This paper takes a certain ultra-large all-slewing floating crane as the research object, analyzing its ocean current load, wave load and their effects on the vessel in the process of normal work. The paper discusses the ocean current and wave load impact on the stability of the floating crane, and how the horizontal impact force and crosswise moments of force are calculated according to the given parameters when the floating crane is affected by crosswise and lengthwise ocean currents. Furthermore, the perpendicular disturbance moments and crosswise drifting forces are calculated based on horizontal and vertical waves. Finally, this approach makes a basis for anti-overturn stability calculations."
"In this paper, the rotor speed and the position of the marine SSP propulsion motor were estimated for building sensorless vector control system with speed and current double closed loops, based on a wavelet square-root unscented Kalman filter (Wavelet-SRUKF) algorithm. The observed data were pretreated by wavelet analysis and the high frequency noise was filtered, thus offering further smooth observed data for the UKF (Unscented Kalman Filter). This Wavelet-SRUKF algorithm can not only filter the spike point but also showed a better dynamic tracing property of the marine SSP podded propulsion system. Simulation results showed that the improved UKF algorithm was more accurate and demonstrated a higher rate of convergence compared with UKF speed controller."
"Three typical regions were selected in Ebinur Lake wetlands of Xinjiang in China, and the nutrient content of their soil was determined with analytical chemistry approaches. Based on the chemical information, the Geostatistics method was employed to analyze the space variability of the soil nutrients for each region. The results were that the comprehensive nutrients level of Region C (Aqikesu River) was higher than those of Region B (Jinghe and Bortala River) and Region A (Alashankou). There is a strong spatial autocorrelation for the soil nutrients studied. Soil organic matter, nitrogen, available phosphorus in every region showed moderate variability, and the variability of potassium depended on the region. The spatial variability of soil nutrients is assumedly caused by climate, topography, soil type, etc. The study is of great significance in understanding the forming process of soil, as well as in providing scientific reference for restoring of soil degradation and dust resistance of the regions studied."
"An automated container terminal (ACT) emphasizes the autonomy of equipment scheduling. The scheduling of the automated stacking crane (ASC) as major equipment has an important impact on the yard operating efficiency. In the export process, ASC cooperated with the quay crane in loading operations. Although traditionally the loading sequence of ASC is generated directly in terms of the stowage plan, with the trend towards automated intelligent terminals, the ASC is becoming increasingly the content of dynamic decision. This paper presents a method of dynamic planning ASC loading sequence after the stowage plan. The method took reshuffling number and ASC movement frequency into account, considered the target vessel slots defined by the stowage plan as constraints, and established a multi-objective mathematical model. Taking into account the problem with NP-hard characteristics, this paper proposed a double-population genetic algorithm based on a general genetic algorithm, establishing a solution mechanism by leveraging genetic exchanges between populations to change the convergence speed. With the completion of a certain bay in the block, it online adjusted the next block collection, and eventually formed a solution of real-time loading sequence. Experiments demonstrated that the algorithm could dynamically obtain the near optimal solution of the problem, adapt the timeliness demand of ASC dynamic decision, and improve the intelligence of the equipment control system (ECS)."
"The topography is low and flat in the estuarine region of the Yangtze River where waterlogged and salt-affected soil has been a latent threat to agricultural development for long time. After the Three-Gorge Project is built up, the Three-Gorge Reservoir seasonally adjusted runoff will impact on the dynamic of soil water and salt in the region. The influence of these relationships is very complicated. In spring, it will cause the river water level to increase so that discharge increases which will not favor desalting. At the same time, the mineral levels of the groundwater will decrease which favors of desalting. In autumn and winter, it will make the river water level drop so that the discharge decreases which favors desalting. However, the mineral level of the groundwater will increase and a salty tide invasion will strengthen which will not favor desalting. The initial predicted result of the numerical simulation shows that salification will be bigger in autumn than desalinization in spring. The degree of impact of the project on the regime of soil salt will be gradually weakened along the river up from the estuary. The nearer to the sea, the bigger the impact, and from cross profiles, the nearer to the river, the bigger the impact. It is more probable that soil will produce salification or secondary salinization especially within 4 kilometers of the river."
"Electric AGV's are a promising horizontal transporter for automated container terminals (ACT), however, its application in ACTs has been held back since the performance of batteries was unsatisfactory. Following the development of battery technology in recent years, the major obstacle impeding the application of AGVs has turned to the management defects, especially in automated container terminals with long travelling distance. In light of this, an event-driven approach for dispatching electric AGVs in ACT's is proposed in this paper. An event-driven assignment model considering battery capacity is raised, in which empty AGVs are always deemed as available for assignment. Moreover, the performance of algorithms for assignment is compared by numerical experiments."
"Studies on the scheduling and decision-making at Port Logistics have mostly been limited to the turn round of ships and/or the throughput capacity of harbors previously, and it has rarely been explored from the perspective of load balancing among logistics service activity lines. Tolling is generally considered to be a method for balancing the supply and demand of social resources. This paper explored the emergence and development of the logistics toll policy. It examined the influence of tolls on consumers' logistics choices, and even the departure time choices. The modern toll policy was mainly designed to reduce traffic congestion. We listed potential motivations for applying the toll policy to balance traffic supply and demand, and then uncovered how it worked. We discussed the approaches for evaluating the logistics toll pricing policy. By introducing a case study, Los Angeles in the State of California, we applied the proposed method to compute the value of time and the value of reliability to evaluate the toll pricing policy. We also verified the actions and reactions of the toll policy in the practical logistics network. Finally, a case of large-scale container terminal was simulated according to the different pressure test modes, and the above algorithms were computed and evaluated in light of the comprehensive analysis of task latency, traffic capacity and load balancing to judge the relative merits."
"As more and more attention has been paid to energy saving, consumption reducing of the port in order to realize the concept of a green port, the number of experts and scholars devoted to the research of energy saving technology in port machinery is increasing. Generally, due to the busy port operations, port machinery could not be divorced from the operating line solely for research. Moreover, the use of real port machinery would impose a high cost for research. Therefore, it was necessary to look for a low-cost, high-precision research platform. In this article, we established a mechanical model, motor model and control model by simulation software based on a real portal crane. And we integrated these three models into the whole simulation platform, providing an energy saving research base by simulating the hoisting and luffing operation of the port crane and analyzing the power change and energy consumption in the hoisting and luffing process. The results of the simulation showed that the simulation platform can completely meet the requirements for portal crane energy saving research."
"Supply chain risk management has drawn great attention from both researchers and practitioners in recent years. Economic globalization and the resultant complexity of the supply chain network plus the uncertainty of the environment makes risk and vulnerability a major challenge to related firms. This paper aims to establish a conceptual model for mitigating supply chain risk by introducing two variables named supply chain integration and organizational risk propensity. Based on extensive literature review, some major propositions are proposed including the following four aspects: supply chain risk is negatively related to supply chain integration; supply chain integration is positively related to company performance; organizational risk propensity moderates the relationship between supply chain risk and supply chain integration; the integrative model is moderated-mediation. The integrative model is theoretically valuable in further exploring the internal path and mechanism of the impact of supply chain risk on a firm's performance. The model is also practically useful in providing suggestions and references for supply chain risk management and supply chain integration. Finally, the future directions for empirical research are also presented."
"Reliability is one of the most important characteristics of the functioning of supply chains. Modeling supply chain's reliability based on common causes of failure between supplier(s) and manufacturers (abbreviated as CCFSM) is a complex and important problem. To identify key factors which cause the failure in the supply chain, the principle of fault tree analysis and the method of Monte Carlo simulation are proposed to apply in the modeling and the algorithm of supply chain's reliability based on CCFSM. After analyzing detailed failure factors which lead to supply chain failure, its diagnostic model is established with the principle of fault tree analysis and the diagnostic algorism of key factors is studied by the method of the Monte Carlo simulation, which can calculate unreliability and the key importance of supply chain. Lastly, the case is presented to prove the model and algorithm's feasibility and validity."
"How to identify the key factors of port-logistics optimization is a hot topic and difficult issue. Taking the Yunnan border port as an example, researching the modeling, analysis, simulation, optimization and equilibrium methods of the border port logistics system under the comprehensive transportation system, the distributed interactive simulation (DIS) framework based-on high level architecture (HLA) was suggested at first, and the system model of the border port logistics system was established using system model language (SysML). To recognize the key factors of the border port-logistics, 9 years of logistics data from the Hekou port was used as a simulation experiment. The results show that the method is feasible and effective, and important in revealing the operational law of the border port logistics system."
"Variations in the settlement process of high filling canals are difficult to predict. This thesis, by means of the ANSYS finite element, determines the law governing the influence of fill height H, elastic modulus E, and Poisson's ratio mu on the settlement of canals and puts forward the lateral deformation correction factor K-1 and additional settlement correction factor K-2 correcting the modulus of compressibility of the fill in the loading process. On the basis of the layered summation method, we establish a calculation method applicable to the settlement variation process of high filling canals. The method involves fewer calculation parameters and allows for the influence of lateral deformation, additional settlement and modulus of compressibility as the depth varies. It is with this method that the settlement variation process and aggregate settlement of high filling canals from the start of filling until the post-fill steadiness of settlement can be legitimately calculated and worked out."
"Rotterdam Port has become a world-class port and the most important port for the continent of Europe. This paper can be divided into four parts. The first part is an introduction to the whole paper. The second part is a general background to port logistics' development and water transportation, and there are also a simple introduction to Rotterdam port and the ports of Jiangsu. It also contains a detailed introduction to the port of Rotterdam and describes the new trends of world ports based on Rotterdam Port's development history. The next part is an analysis of the ports of Jiangsu in comparison with the Rotterdam port by looking at the strengths, weaknesses, opportunities and threats. The last part is the conclusion of the paper. Through the four parts, some ideas have been given in regards to the future development of the ports of Jiangsu."
"By investigating the current situation of container shipping organization at the middle and upper reaches of the Yangtze River, it was discovered that current transport organizations do not follow the basic law of ""large ship with long line, small with short line"" but conform to a government subsidies policy. This paper constructs a integer programming optimization model of the container Hub-and-Spoke transport in the middle and upper reaches of Yangtze River and indicates that the container Hub-and-Spoke transport organization mode in the middle and upper reaches of Yangtze River with the axis of the section of Wuhan Newport-Shanghai Yangshan port area is optimized, compared with the existing transport organization mode, which can lead to 5% and 8.4% drop in generalized total transport cost and fuel consumption respectively given the existing ship types as well as 15.3% and 20.1% decreases respectively given the optimal ship types. As the government subsidy policy misled the behavior of the ship market managers, the negative effects caused by the behavior of government and ship managers have also been quantified and analyzed, and a policy aimed at the development of the optimization of the container transport organization in the middle and upper reaches of Yangtze River have been put forward."
"The Luanjiaoyang Seas are an important part of the East China Sea with rich fishery resources and a good ecological environment. In this study, spatial and temporal characteristics of the community structures of Zooplankton in the Luanjiaoyang Seas, Ningbo were described, including diversity index and environmental factors by using quantitative and qualitative methods. Sampling was carried out in December 2011 and in April, July, and October 2012. The results showed that of 104 species, Copepods, Protozoa and Planktonic larvaeas accounted for 53, 18 and 14 species respectively. The species number was at a maximum in summer and at a minimum in spring and this abundance applied to sites near the coast, the farther coast sites and the farthest coast sites. The results showed that the pattern of the community was significantly different, and the differences in the community were beyond 75%. The Margalef richness index (d) ranged from 0.32 to 1.17 (average 0.83); the Shannon-Weiner diversity index (H') range from 1.92 to 3.74 (average 2.74); the Pielou evenness index (J) ranged from 1.21 to 1.39 (average 1.28); while the Simpson index (D) averaged 0.80. The sea community was stable."
"Relying on the East Sea Wind Farm project in China, the laterally loaded tests using the unidirectional and single cycle loading test methods were conducted on full-size inclined steel pipe piles filled with concrete. The internal force and deformation of piles, the critical bearing capacity, and lateral soil pressure were obtained from the full-scale test. The results show that the location of the maximal bending moment of pile shaft was at the depth of 2.5 similar to 3.5 meters beneath the soil surface level and soil resistance of the pile with a positive inclination angle was more than that with a negative inclination angle. The results also indicated that the p-y curves of all test piles increased linearly when the lateral displacement at pile head was smaller than 20 mm."
"In this paper, the remaining capacity of lead-acid batteries is used to evaluate the health status of RTG energy systems. A LS-SVM model was established for predicting the remaining capacity of batteries, with the PSO-BP algorithm optimizing the parameters in the LS-SVM model. Using the trained LS-SVM model, the remaining capacity of batteries and the degradation trend of battery capacity with time are predicted. Compared with measured results, the predicted results show that the LS-SVM model can accurately predict the remaining capacity of lead-acid batteries."
"The Jiuduan Shoal has the most extensive tidal channel system in the Yangtze River estuary diara, and the construction of the Deep-Water Channel Project in the Yangtze River estuary has had a significant effect on the distribution and morphology of tidal channels. Taking tidal channels in the Jiuduan Shoal in Yangtze River estuary as a research object, using remote sensing data which was extracted from 1997 to 2013, we analyzed the influence of the Deep-Water Channel Project in the Yangtze River estuary on the ecological landscape of Jiuduan Shoal tidal channels by using landscape indexes such as Total Class Area (CA), Number of Patches (NP), Patch Density (PD), Percentage of Landscape (PLAND), Landscape Shape Index (LSI), Fractal Dimension Index (FRAC), and Largest Patch Index (LPI). Graded tidal channels by using the principle of Horton - Strahler of image of 2013. We found that, in the 1st and the 2nd phase of the project, the proportion of the tidal channel area increased compared to the previous period, but by the end of the 2nd phase project in 2013, the proportion of the total landscape area made up of tidal channels accounted for less in successive years; NP, PD, LSI, and LPI fluctuated in the first phase of Deep-Water Channel Project, after this tidal channels of Jiuduan Shoal maintained the same trend, namely, the tidal channels aggregation degree decreased year by year. The distribution of tidal channels tended toward separation which shows that the tidal channels fragmentation is increasing year by year. By the end of the third phase of construction, the shape of the tidal channels became gradually different and tended to be more discrete. The shape complexity increased and the tidal channels became more and more mature and complicated and can be seen in the same grade of Jiuduan Shoal tidal channels, which on the left side of the dimensions change range are greater than the right, namely, the tidal channels on the left side are more complex than the right. In different grades of of tidal channels, the change range of the minimum width is little, but the maximum is quite large. There is little relevance between the changes in the width of the different grades of tidal channels and its fractal dimension difference values between the left and right sides. In different grades of tidal channels, whether left or right, the fractal dimension values increase with the average width and grade number of tidal channels."
"To address the difficulty of designing lattice material structures, five different unit cells are presented including edge structure, vertex structure, face center structure, interconnect vertex structure and cross face center structure. The finite element analysis (FEA) method is introduced to analyze the mechanical properties of these five typical unit cells. It is indicated that, when stressed, bended or twisted with the same shape, size, mass, and loading force by changing their cellular pillar section R, the edge structure possesses optimal performance. The simulation results of the functional efficiency and bearing efficiency data obtained for various unit cells could shed some light on the lattice material designing under different loading conditions."
"In this study, an interval-parameter two-stage stochastic integer programming model (ITSIP) was developed for urban water resource planning under uncertainty. ITSIP incorporates pre-regulated water resources management policies directly into its optimization process to analyze various policy scenarios. Each scenario has a different economic penalty when the agreed water-allocation targets are violated. Methods of interval-parameter and stochastic programming were applied to tackle uncertainties described by both interval value and probability distributions, while binary variables were used to model processes such as shunting. The developed method can provide a link between economic cost and the associated penalties attributed to the violation of pre-regulated policies. The model was used in a case study of an urban water supply system that withdraws water from multiple sources. A number of scenarios corresponding to different river inflow levers were examined, and the results indicated that different inflow levels could lead to differing water allocation schemes with varied system costs and failure risks. The model proved to be valuable for identifying management regimes that minimize cost under different decision scenarios with various levels of stream flow."
"When using the response surface model for model updating, the efficiency is higher than using the traditional sensitivity based on finite element (FE) model updating method, as the simple polynomial response surface (RS) model is adapted to optimize the iteration instead of the complicated finite element model. However, the selection of the parameters to be updated for model updating in the response surface model is usually based on experience, which will lead the updating results to be subjective. In this paper, a main factor sensitivity analysis based RS model updating method was put forward, and the main parameters in the RS model were determined according to the sensitivity analysis of the design parameters in the FE model of the structure onto the multi-frequency optimization object function. By combining the central composite design, quadratic polynomial and least square estimation technique, a set of response surface regression models of structure frequencies were built, and the fgoalattain algorithm was applied to solve and optimize the multi-frequency response surface model. The updating results of the port crane structure model with this method showed that the reasonable main factors could be attained, and that the frequency response surface models could accurately describe the calculated frequencies of the FE model. The updating results were highly accurate and efficient, which means that the method put forward in this paper was applicable to the updating of the FE models of large and complicated port crane structures."
"Information on the depths and widths of the wetted zone of substrate is a pre-requisite for the design and operation of drip irrigation systems. A semi-empirical model was developed using the dimensional analysis method to simulate the geometry of wetted substrate zone under drip irrigation. The simulated values of the wetted width and wetted depth were compared with those obtained through field experiments to test model applicability. Statistical analysis revealed that the values of Mean Square Error, Mean Error and Model Efficiency were 1.11 cm, 0.53 cm and 80.6% at least respectively. For the prediction of wetted width and depth of substrate T-1 and T-2, therefore, the develop model can be used to describe wetted substrate patterns under drip irrigation system with an emitter."
"Plain reservoirs in drought areas are often characterized by low water levels and large surface areas. These reservoirs lose much of their water to evaporation. To counteract this, this paper proposes reducing invalid evaporation from plain reservoirs by way of benzene board covering technology. In field experiments, we measured the efficiency of the evaporation reduction rate of water, analyzed the connection and fixation mode for stabilizing the benzene boards, and discussed engineering measures of water saving by preventing water from evaporating from the plain reservoirs in drought areas. Experimental results showed that invalid evaporation from plain reservoirs was reduced by as much as 51.25%. This demonstrates that with a reasonable connection and fixation of benzene boards, this technology can be used to effectively reduce invalid evaporation from plain reservoirs."
"To reveal the impacts of sea reclamation on fish communities in adjacent areas, Caofeidian in north China was chosen as a case study in this paper. A total of 19 sample points were set in offshore areas reclaimed in 2004, 2008, and 2010, which represents the beginning, middle and ending phase of reclamation works. Species richness, density, biomass, and biodiversity index were analyzed to describe changes of adjacent fish community during the reclamation process. It is found that the fish density declined by 22.66% from 2004 to 2010 due to sea reclamation. The fish biomass decreased from 46.07 kg.m(-)h(-1) in 2004 to 25.35 kg.m(-2).h(-1) in 2010, which was mainly caused by body miniaturization of dominated fish and increased density of other fish species. The sea reclamation also reduced the eggs and fries in adjacent areas. The density of fish eggs decreased from 5.42 ind.m(-3).h(-1) to 0.13 ind.m(-3).h(-1) and the density of fries decreased from 2.29 ind.m(-3).h(-1) to 0.19 ind.m(-3).h(-1). These changes of fish community were mainly due to the plenty of suspended sand diffused to adjacent waters. Besides, the impact of reclamation on fish community was bigger in autumn than in spring."
"With the development of the loading capacity of the port machines, rail cracks have become a safety problem during operation. As rail cracks' geometric properties change, load distribution is rearranged at the crack tips, which affects the propagation tendency of the crack. In this study, simulations of rail surface crack growth under rolling contact fatigue (RCF) were presented based on a 3D finite element model. More specifically, the focus was on the calculation of the stress intensity factors at the crack tip fronts of short surface crack as well as the variation of the crack geometric properties such as the crack's size, inclination angle and shape, etc. The results showed that with the increase of the crack size, the propagation rate increases to a maximum and then decreases when the crack extends away from the domination of RCF loadings. Moreover, with the increase of the crack inclined angle, the crack propagation rate decreases, but this is only true when the crack size is small. Under RCF, the propagation rate at the rail surface in lateral direction was higher than that at the deepest crack tip, which leads the crack to develop from semi-circular into semi-elliptical, and the propagation rate of semi-elliptical crack is higher than the semi-circular one with the same crack size."
"With the development of the economy, the demand for energy will rise steadily and mineral energy will be in short supply. Renewable marine energy has many advantages including being cleaned, renewable and not causing pollution. In addition, marine energy enjoys a large reserve which can help supply the energy for island residents. In the long-term, it can relieve the energy scarcity problem and improve energy structure. Therefore, this energy sources plays a strategic role for China. However, due to technology costs and the difficulty of maintaining equipment quality, the development of marine energy is slow. There are many obstacles in the comprehensive plan, including the input of R&D and the management system. In order to exploit the marine energy in China, we must take into account things such as the cost of technology, equipment, electric lines, electricity transmission and maintenance."
"In this paper, the container Stacking Position Determination Problem (SPDP) for inbound containers in the process of vessel loading and unloading activities is discussed, specifically focusing on the storage space allocation problem (SSAP) in container terminals. The process of positioning inbound containers is investigated and analyzed based on an advanced handling strategy, namely assigning quay cranes in their full utilization with the aim of ""Full In & Full Out"" that is proposed for internal trucks, where intense loading and unloading activities are considered at the same time. A multi-objective integer programming model (MOIPM) is then put forward based on the idea of real-time strategic planning. For the solution, a genetic algorithm (GA) is employed to address the formulated problem. In addition to the effectiveness and reliability of the proposed model, a number of experimental results also verify the robustness of the GA algorithm. The application of the proposed method is able to improve operational efficiency in container terminals and reduce handling costs as well."
"This paper tests the raw water sample from the Qingdao sewage treatment plant and studies influence of the ferroporphyrin content in FeCl3 coagulant on coagulation effect. The results indicate that the ferroporphyrin content in FeCl3 coagulant is non-linearly correlated with removal effect of total phosphorus and CODCr in sewage. When the ferroporphyrin content is 25% in FeCl3, 16.0 mg/L addition volume can reduce the CODCr content in the supernatant to 195mg/L, the removal rate reaches 56.7%, total phosphorus content reduces to 1.7mg/L, and the removal rate reaches 70.7%. When the ferroporphyrin content in FeCl3 will continue reduction till 0.4%, the removal rate of CODCr and total phosphorus are only improved by 1.1% and 1.3%. From the view of the price/performance ratio, when the FeCl3 coagulant is used as the raw water coagulation in the sewage, the ferroporphyrin content limit regulated in the product quality standard can be properly relaxed to reduce the production cost of the ferric chloride coagulant."
"Since China has begun to implement stringent CO2 emission regulation, foreign trade competitiveness suffers from great impact. Under fixed emission regulation concerning different emission distribution methods, there exist differences in effects on export competitiveness as well as industrial transformation and upgrading. In this paper, based on the bilateral panel data of China and 32 trading partners during 1992 and 2011, model of multiple panel regression is applied to conduct empirical analysis on the influence of CO2 emission regulation. The results show that the enhancement of CO2 emission regulation is conducive to the improvement of the export competitiveness of Chinese manufacturing industries. Meanwhile, there are different influence degrees of regulation on various industries, among which the clean industry is the most influenced by the regulation. As for various manufacturing industries, there are three distribution policies, namely, emission distribution on the basis of output, average distribution on the basis of unit emission and accumulative distribution on the basis of unit emission. Moreover, the advantages and disadvantages of the influences of these three policies on export competitiveness, transformation and upgrading of Chinese manufacturing industries would be compared so as to determine which distribution policy is most beneficial. The results illustrate that ""average CO2 emission distribution on the basis of unit emission"" makes the greatest contribution to the export transformation and upgrading of Chinese manufacturing industries, and it is in conformity with development need of Chinese trade at current phase. The innovation of the paper lies in its adoption of bilateral trade data to specifically study the influence of CO2 emission regulation on trade competitiveness. The attention is specially attached to the performance differences of different emission distribution policies in trade competitiveness, which is the further exploration on the basis of previous studies."
"As an advanced engineering technology, root reinforcement has been practically applied in the coastal slope protection, but the theoretical study has lagged behind. Based on the geotechnical engineering slope theory and plant ecology, it is still needed to apply new root-soil interaction and mechanical models to provide approaches for the numerical analysis on slope stability. As the plant roots growth is complicated and changes with the coastal rock and soil, it is important to use accurate methods to assess root strengthen ability. According to the slope protection action mechanism of the vegetation and the stress-strain pattern analysis, the model of reinforcement mechanism is established to deduce the general mathematical equation of the root systematic resist-slipping stress to provide a theoretical basis for coastal slope protection design."
"Owing that the container terminals increasingly occupy a crucial position in today's container transportation, the advanced and cost-effective operational management gradually attracts the attention of terminal operators. The relevant research survey in this paper is carried out on various operational task flows in a container yard. In terms of operational features of vehicle-mounted tasks in storage yard, such as complexity, instantaneity, derivatization and flexibility, a two-layer workflow engine framework is proposed to support dynamic scheduling. ECA rules and the features of a directed graph are combined to formulate a bottom-layer workflow model, which enables the model to implement dynamic assignment. And the upper-layer workflow drive is composed of three parts, the task generation, processing and mutation. It regulates the generation, mutation and elimination of operational tasks in a container yard. On the basis of long-term practical experience and application in multiple yards of Tianjin Port in China, the effectiveness and feasibility of the proposed workflow engine is verified. The application of the technical framework provides a practical reference for operational control and management in logistics enterprises."
"With respect to the design and construction of grouting and drainage works, the conventional method is to locate the grout hole and drainage hole in the direction perpendicular to the natural rock or excavation surface. The anisotropy of structural planes in leaking water or grout has been neglected in the design of the works. Investigation data about rock fissures are studied to find out the distribution law of structural planes and know how to best locate boreholes with respect to structural planes in order to get an optimum effect of grouting and drainage. A new method is put forward for locating grout holes and bore holes. The practice from the Houhe Reservoir shows the inclined borehole less than 75 degrees has an obvious efficiency, and among the boreholes within the angle range of 65 to 75, the optimum locations have an average efficiency of 2.11."
"Bridges with low clearance crossing sea are generally partially or fully submerged by surge or wave. The safety of bridge girder in the splash zones is closely related to wave impact. Using the 2D numerical wave-tank established by ANSYS FLUENT, authors make comparative analysis of the numerical simulation results of wave forces acting on three kinds of twin-deck girders (circular arc box girder, trapezoid box girder and T-shaped girder) of bridge with low clearance crossing sea. Wave forces on bridge girder under different circumstances were analyzed. The circumstances include different bridge deck elevation, different seabed elevation, and the influence of revetment. Then authors got economically reasonable, safe and reliable optimal bridge girder cross-section form. It proves that the box girder with arc-shaped bottom is considered to be the best form. For coastal twin-deck bridges with low clearance, there is an optimum deck elevation from sea level."
"As cracks occurred widely on the webs of cart balance beam of quayside container cranes, a proposal has been offered that we should know about the value of horizontal force of quayside container crane under operating conditions based on the force analysis. In view of this, a site test has been carried out. By testing the variation of stresses of cart balance beam under different working conditions, the scope of horizontal force has been obtained. In the end, the factors which may influence the variation of horizontal force have been discussed."
"Based on the first engineering application of new-type sheet-pile wharf with barrier piles, the field test has been conducted for 7 years. According to the long term field testing results, the structure forces of the wharf front wall and barrier piles have been obtained in different periods. The results have showed that the new wharf structure was effective for a large harbor basin, the maximum positive bending moments for both front wall and barrier piles appeared in dredging period, and the maximum negative bending moment appeared in operation period. The rebar stress of front wall was about twice larger than that of barrier piles. In order to make full use of the potential bearing capacity of front wall and barrier piles, the optimal design was to make them in the same stress level. The modified bending moment calculation method has been proposed based on the field testing data."
"It is of great importance for port managers to know whether they have fully used their existing infrastructures and that output has been maximized given the amount of input. From this perspective, data envelopment analysis (DEA) provides a more appropriate benchmark for the container port. By applying three kinds of DEA models, this study acquires a variety of analytical results about operational efficiency of the worlds' leading container ports. According to efficiency value analysis, this study firstly finds out the reason of inefficiency. Then, it is followed by identification of the potential areas of improvement for inefficient ports by applying slack variable method. Furthermore, return to scale approach is used to assess whether each port is in a state of increasing, decreasing, or constant return to scale. Finally, by utilization of the sensitivity analysis, this study can identify which input or output variables are more critical to the model, and which one will have more impact on. The results of this study can provide port managers with insights into resource allocation and optimization of the operating performance."

"The flexural behavior of the corroded reinforced concrete (RC) beam with different concrete strengths under fatigue loading has not been truly well-understood. Twelve RC beams (section size 120x200; total length 1700 mm; clear span 1500 mm) with concrete strengths (C20, C25, C30, and C35) were tested under specified fatigue and monotonic load in this study. The tests were aimed to evaluate the mechanical behavior of the corroded reinforced concrete beams with different failure patterns after fatigue and monotonic loading. The parameters evaluated in this experimental study include distortion, stress distribution and ultimate strength of the corroded reinforced concrete beams. The results showed that the load capacity and the rigidity of the corroded beams are increased with the concrete strength. The performance of the RC beams is greatly affected by the corrosion in terms of fatigue capacity, which reduces the ultimate strength and the ductility of the beams significantly."
"The microstructure evolution and continuous cooling transformation curves of the simulated heat-affected zone of a developed high strength and high toughness weld metal was investigated by means of thermal simulation on a Gleeble 3,500. This weld metal was picked up from the welding joint of a high strength and high toughness pipeline steel which was welded with commercial welding materials. Results showed that fine acicular ferrite was the main microstructure during a wide range of cooling rates. Actual welding experiment was also carried out with the heat input of 21 kJ/cm. The yield strength of the weld joint in weld metal is 875 MPa. The average impact toughness are about 104 and 183 J at -30 degrees C in weld metal and the fusion line, respectively. The observed results indicated that the developed weld metal had superior mechanical properties compared to the required properties in API Spec 5L standard of high strength and high toughness pipeline steels X120, which was attributed to low carbon design and suitable alloying."
"The dynamic responses of a new kind of sheet-pile wharf under horizontal seismic loads have been simulated by using the finite element method, and the influences of earthquakes' characteristics have been analyzed in detail. Compared with the traditional sheet-pile wharf, the separated relieving platform system has been adopted for the new wharf and the dock basin could be much deeper for larger ships. The results of the numerical calculation show that the separated relieving platform system is still effective under seismic loads, and the maximum internal force of structural elements doesn't change when earthquake acceleration reaches the peak value. With the increase of the earthquake peak ground acceleration value, the maximum internal force of structural elements all increases at different degrees, the amplification of the bending moment is the largest, those of tie rod's tension force and anchor wall's bending moment are a bit smaller than that of the front wall, and those of front pile and back pile's bending moment are the smallest. The amplification coefficients of all internal force under the Kobe wave loads are always bigger than those under the EL-Centro wave with the same PGA value, which indicates that, in addition to the earthquake wave peak value, the responses are also affected by other earthquake characteristics, such as spectrum, wave energy density and wave total energy."
"This paper presents the numerical solutions for consolidation of the under-consolidated dredger fills. By a field test the delivery rules of negative vacuum pressure in the PVDs are studied, the relationship between permeability and effective stress of the high water content soil is also studied by an experiment, then a plain strain FEM program was coded for the dredger fills consolidation analysis in which the nonlinearity constitutive relation Duncan-Chang's model is applied into the Biot's consolidation theory, and the nonlinear permeability law is also employed in the Biot's consolidation theory. As an under-consolidated soil, the self-weight that is not consolidated before the enforcement and negative vacuum pressure is included as the consolidation load in this paper. At last, two project cases were calculated using this program, the result showed that the program was suitable to analyze the under-consolidated soil consolidation under vacuum preloading or surcharge preloading method."
"Based on DEA-Malmquist index method, this paper analyzes the total factor productivity of 11 Chinese coastal cities' marine economy during the period of ""11th five-year plan"" and it comparatively analyzes the regional differences of economic efficiency in these areas. The results show the overall level of marine economy development efficiency of China's coastal cities is not high. According to the TFP decomposition, most regions have got reasonable urban resource allocation. Technology progress is the major force for developing marine economy. In regions which have got unreasonable resource allocation, with the decomposition of efficiency changing value, it shows that pure technical efficiency is the main reason of causing the change of low efficiency. What's more, scale efficiency develops either too fast or too slow. When government regulates and controls the development of marine economy, large hysteresis exists in policy guidance."
"As a part of scheduling, Berth Allocation Problem can be considered as a problem of minimizing the total service time of vessels which berth at the port. The purpose is to optimize the efficiency of the port and the passing rate of vessels. The balanced deployment issues of yards can be transformed into considered as an equilibrium assignment of yard storage. The purpose is to give the loading vessels more choices to choose their best lanes and enhance the efficiency of the yard, as well as reduce the transportation costs. This paper combines berth allocation and yard assignment problems to build a collaborative berth allocation model with multiple ports under the background of bulk ports. The objective of this model consists of two parts: The minimization of total service time of vessels and the equilibrium assignment of yard storage. This paper uses two approaches to solve the above-mentioned mixed integer nonlinear programming problems: IBM ILOG CPLEX and Genetic Algorithm. According to the actual data of Majishan Port and Ore Transfer Terminal of Lake Shulang, many numerical experiments are conducted. This paper analyzes and compares these two approaches and proves the validity and accuracy of Genetic Algorithm and CPLEX. The model and the analysis procedure of numerical experiments are of certain reference value and practical significance on the management of berth allocation and yard assignment with multiple ports."

"Take control charts as the principal statistical process control tools. The recognition accuracy of abnormal control chart patterns (CCPs) directly influences the quality control of production process. (Most of the existing studies focus on the basic recognition of abnormal CCPs, but the observed process data could be of mixture patterns in real world, which consists of two or three basic patterns. This paper introduces a hybrid intelligent model for recognizing the mixture control chart pattern that includes three main aspects: feature extraction, classifier and parameter optimization. In feature extraction, statistical and sharp features of observation data are used as data input and principal component analysis as the second feature extraction to get the effective data of the classifier. A multi-class support vector machine (SVM) is applied for recognizing the mixture patterns. Finally, adaptive mutation particle swam optimization is used to optimize the SVM classifier by searching the best values of the parameters of SVM kernel function. The simulation results show the proposed algorithm with little features has better recognition accuracy compared with other methods."
"For reverberation, interlay multiples, and other short-period multiples commonly seen in seas, predictive deconvolution of multiple attenuation is not very effective. In this paper, adaptive predictive deconvolution is proposed through which the prediction step and factor length can be automatically set by the distribution cycle and scope of different multiples. Model comparisons showed that the new method has obvious advantages in processing interlayer multiples with high energy and ambiguous wave-group characteristics and is verified by real data. Some key resulting maps are analyzed and compared. This method has good potential."
"Marine magnetic survey is an important mean of geophysical exploration. The magnetic disturbance magnitude, the start and end time, and perfecting magnetic disturbance model are important for magnetic survey. In this paper, on the basis of that dual-frequency GNSS is able to get the ionospheric total electron content, reflect the nature of the magnetic disturbance characteristics, etc. the study of magnetic disturbance correction in marine magnetism measurements using dual-frequency GNSS is carried out. Through quality controlled by the dual-frequency GNSS phase observations, ionospheric total electron content solved by static and dynamic at slant direction. Comparing the solving with geomagnetic observatories and marine magnetic measurements, the solution showed that there is relatively strong correlation between ionospheric total electron content and marine magnetic surveys. This fact helps to perfect magnetic interference correction model and improve the accuracy of magnetic measurement. Also it is a good foundation for the application of GNSS to carry out new areas."
"GPS data dedicated to tidal level are usually processed using differential techniques. Unfortunately, the precision of resulting kinematic positions is baseline-length dependent. So, high precision tidal level measurements using differential GPS techniques are limited to coasts, lakes, and rivers. Recent improvements in GPS satellite products (orbits, clocks, and phase biases) make Precise Point Positioning (PPP) technique reach cm-level in three dimensions. At same time, EGM2008 determine the sea level also reached centimeter level. So Precise Point Positioning technique with EGM2008 opens up tidal level measurements without Tidal Gauges. This paper recalls the concept of PPP technique and discusses the precision of GPS shipborne positioning. Tidal data of large-scale sea are calculated from PPP and EGM2008. Some results are gotten. (1) Compliance of tidal height, which obtained from measurements and model, increases in sequence as distance apart from seashore increases. (2) The Cycle, amplitude of the tide calculated by PPP and EGM2008 is more obvious, the performance characteristics more clearly, solving characteristics and theoretical tidal level characteristics match well. (3) Marine gravity measurements result shows that FAA (Free-air anomaly) and BG (Bouguer anomaly) calculated from PPP are similar with those from conventional method, but depth from former is better than that from latter. From above results, PPP technique is a feasible method to determine tidal height."
"With the rapid development of land-based Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) positioning technology, the high-precision oceanic GNSS positioning demands are more extensive. A real-time precise point positioning (PPP) method based on regional Continuous Operation Reference Stations (CORS) for ocean application is proposed in the paper. Starting fromthe requirement of real-time satellite orbit and clock products for the real-time PPP, the accuracy of IGU (International GNSS service Ultra-rapid) orbit product and its correlation with prediction time were analyzed. Also, a new easy and effective real-time estimation method of satellite clock based on regional CORS network was proposed, and the estimated clock was compared with the IGS final clock products. Then based on predicted IGU orbit and estimated real-time clock products, real-time PPP experiments in long-distance away areas were carried out to simulate ocean application. Experimental results show that the average RMS of estimated clock is less than 0.1ns compared with the IGS final clock. In the real-time PPP experiments, the average convergence time of the two selected long-distance areas are 16.5 minutes and 15.6 minutes respectively. The positioning errors in the three directions (North/East/Up) are within 6 cm after 1-hour filtering. The contents researched in the paper verify the feasibility of real-time PPP based on regional CORS for oceanic application and provide a new possible strategy for oceanic positioning application."
"A new way of the Gulf tidal energy development has been proposed to use the dynamic water-head inside and outside the Gulf for tidal power generation. Tide inconsistency will happen when it reaches the bottom of the Gulf and outside the Gulf, leading to delay of the tide on the Gulf bottom. A dynamic water-level difference is thus forming between inside and outside the Gulf, which can be used as tidal power water-head. An ideal tidal energy gulf is built up for the hydrodynamic numerical simulation. Results show that the new tidal energy development method is feasible. It greatly improves the efficiency of tidal energy compared with traditional tidal power generation way. The new idea is first proposed in the world on tidal energy, which would bring substantial changes to the traditional way on tidal energy power generation."
"Accurate prediction of tidal level with strong meteorological effects is very important for human activities in oceanic and coastal areas. Under severe weather, such as typhoons, the contribution of non-astronomical components to tidal level may be as significant as that of astronomical components. The traditional harmonic analysis method and other models based on the analysis of astronomical components do not work well in these situations. The objective of this paper is to select an effective method for predicting the tidal level under the influence of typhoons at Luchaogang, China. The linear regression, back-propagation (BP) and radial basis function neural network methods are compared. Based on the typhoon data and tidal-level data gathered from Pudong Hydrological Bureau, seven parameters of typhoon are extracted and employed as input parameters while the corresponding tidal-level data are adopted as output parameters. The results have shown that the BP method performs best in the prediction of tidal level with a typhoon effect, and that the BP neural network method can provide a solid basis for tidal-level prediction and typhoon disaster reduction."
"While focusing on the ability of climate models, this paper demonstrates the role and status of atmospheric dynamics and thermodynamics in building and developing climate models. Possible reasons for the insufficiency in climate models are analyzed, and the significance of non-equilibrium thermodynamics in further development of climate models, especially of regional climate models, is put forward. Besides, in non-equilibrium thermodynamics, the second law of thermodynamics indicates that, in an isolated system, irreversible process develops along the direction of increasing entropy whatever status the system is at the beginning, while the minimum entropy production principle states that non-equilibrium open system grows toward the status with minimum entropy production, which can be used as the development criterion for the non-equilibrium open system. As the typical open non-equilibrium system, atmospheric system undoubtedly follows some of the theorems of non-equilibrium thermodynamics. Therefore, the non-equilibrium thermodynamics theory has broad applicational prospects in climate modeling and prediction."
"Island is the meeting place of land and sea. The unique geographical environment makes it highly vulnerable to various natural disasters, especially to typhoons. Natural disaster is a complex phenomenon involving Earth's surface dynamics affected by the combined forces of many elements in nature. Based on the theory of natural disaster risk analysis, this paper will analyze how typhoon disaster affects the populated island from three aspects of disaster-causing factors including vulnerability of hazard-bearing body, disaster prevention and mitigation capacity, as well as the defense strategy and specific measures taken by governments and individuals in response to typhoon disaster. The research results have important theoretical implications for the study of islands' typhoons risk assessment."
"Using the WOUDC observational data and absorption cross sections of O-3 and SO2, SO2, the paper has calculated absorption coefficients and the theoretical factor C to analyze the influence of sulfur dioxide (SO2) on Dobson spectrophotometer total ozone measurement. The calculation results show that: SO2 absorption coefficient Delta gamma AD is 1.843, and influence factor C related to Delta gamma(AD) has obvious seasonal variation that reaches a maximum in winter and a minimum in summer; moreover, the presence of SO2 leads to higher amount of Dobson ozone than the actual values. After the correction by using the factor C, the relative difference between Dobson and Brewer data sets shows a decrease by 1 similar to 3%. On the other hand, the effect of SO2 on Dobson total ozone is reduced due to the decrease of total SO2, but it should still be taken into account during a high-pollution period."
"Four identical hydrodynamic simulation experiments for the Bohai Sea have been implemented respectively with MIKE31 model based on four different coastlines of 2000, 2008, 2010, and 2012, when the intensive usage of the Bohai Sea was carried on. The comparison of these four experiments is used to present the influence on the Bohai Sea tidal system caused by coastline modification. The analysis shows that the semi-diurnal amphidromic point near the Yellow River estuary moves towards south-east gradually as the coastline changes, which makes the semi-diurnal amplitude in Bohai Bay increase and the phase rotate anticlockwise. Meanwhile, the semi-diurnal amplitude in Laizhou Bay becomes smaller and the phase rotates clockwise. Besides, the semi-diurnal amphidromic point near Qinhuang Island moves gradually to southwest. The location of diurnal amphidromic point in Bohai Strait has no obvious changes, but the amplitudes of diurnal tide increase in all three bays."
"The West Guangdong Ocean Current (WG current) is a special ocean current flowing along the West Guangdong coastline, China. It has significant impact on the nearshore area, and it will make the nearshore current movement complex after superposing on the tidal currents. A comprehensive investigation of the WG current is mandatory especially to the construction of nearshore harbors. However, at present, the nature of WG current is still not well clarified. Based on a series of filed survey datasets carried out in different representative seasons, the movement characteristics of the WG current are analyzed by using a residual flow extracting method. The results indicate that the WG current direction points to southwest in the entire year, which does not accord with the dominant monsoon direction especially in summer, and the current speed shows significant seasonal variation. The current speed increases at the first 10 km away from shoreline, and then becomes approximately uniform. Besides, the current speed is larger in summer than that in winter."
"The periodicity analysis and correlation analysis about river runoff and basinwide precipitation in a river are widely used. While there exists a problem in previous periodicity analysis and correlation analysis, which here refers to lacking consideration of human impacts on river runoff. This problem may obscure the results of periodicity analysis and correlation analysis. For the case of the Yangtze River and the Yellow River, we carried out periodicity analysis and correlation analysis about river runoff and basinwide precipitation. The primary analyses without consideration of human impacts show that there are clear periods and high correlation between annual runoff and annual precipitation of the Yangtze River in humid zone, while the periods and correlation are not clear in the Yellow River in arid and semiarid zones. The discussion indicates that water consumption within the Yellow River basin is often in the same order of magnitude as that of actual water discharge, which could affect the periodicity analysis and correlation analysis. Therefore, one argument is presented that human impacts (i.e. water diversions) on the river runoff should be considered in the process of periodicity analysis and correlation analysis of a river between arid and semi-arid climatic zones, where water consumption is often in the same order of magnitude as that of actual water discharge."
"Lots of super-size coarse-grained soil was distributed along the central line of the Water Diversion Project from South to North in China, the diameter of soil grain exceeded the measuring range of existing devices for seepage coefficient of coarse-grained soil. Special measuring device is developed, canister diameter of measurement is increased; accelerated exhaust method is carried out; grading increasing method of seepage gradient is used, and corresponding method of test is carried out. The test shows that the adaptable range of character diameter value (d(85)) of soil grain is from 60 mm to 100 mm, and accelerated exhaust method overcomes some problems which are bigger in diameter of specimen, lower in penetrability of materials, more difficult in saturation of specimen and so on, and grading increasing method of seepage gradient decreases destruction of specimen. The technique can be used in penetrability test and detection of project quality for super-size coarse-grained soil."
"Based on Support Vector Machine (SVM) and decision trees (DTs) classification methods, in this paper, we take Harbin, Daqing, Suihua, and Qiqihar in Heilongjiang Province as study area for land cover/use classification. Feature bands representing land surface characteristics are extracted from MODIS data, such as Enhanced Vegetation Index (EVI), four texture characteristics, and Land Surface Water Index (LSWI). Compared with the classification results, we think that SVM and DTs methods each have advantages, and also can achieve high classification accuracy. The overall classification accuracies are 87.68% and 89.13%, Kappa coefficient of 0.86, 0.87, respectively. The result shows is DTs method with slightly higher classification accuracy is more suitable for the land cover/use classification of the study area than SVM."
"CRI system is a new technology of sewage disposal which involves less investment, low operating cost, favorable treatment effects and so on. In 2007, a CRI system was built to improve the water quality of Phoenix River. The practical operation shows that: the layout of the CRI system is appropriate and in accord with the practical situation of pollutant sources. Operation results show that CRI system is good at removing the NH3, COD, SS and so on, effluent water is stable in CRI system, and the CRI system has stronger ability to resist impact load. The effluent NH3, COD and SS concentrations can meet the A-level of primary standard of plant emission standards (GB 18918-2002) in Municipal wastewater treatment. But the removal efficiency is bad for TP and TN and the ultimate effluent is not qualified for the A-level of primary standard of plant emission standards (GB 18918-2002) in Municipal wastewater treatment. When improving the CRI system, it must consider changing the structure of the pool filter layer, filter material composition and operation mode to improve the removal efficiency of TN and TP in CRI system."
"Pipe-soil interaction is a crucial problem in the global buckling design of submarine pipeline under thermal stresses. Soil resistance acting on the pipelines determines the deformation shape and amplitude as the global buckling occurs. The fine sand and soft clay are distributed widely in the upper soil layer of Bohai Gulf. Therefore, these two kinds of soil were chosen as medium in the pipe-soil interaction laboratory tests. Three different diameter pipe segments were adopted to simulate the pipeline. The pipe segments lateral displacement and the corresponding suffered soil resistance were measured during the tests. The tests were carried out separately for the pipe segments with different diameters and different depth to diameter ratios. The test data showed that the lateral soil resistance acting on the pipe depends on the soil properties and pipe diameter and depth-to-diameter ratio. A numerical method was established to simulate the test data. Based on the results fitting well to the test data, the developed method was applied to analyzing the soil resistance acting on actual size pipelines. The relationship between the peak resistance and the corresponding displacement was obtained with considering the pipe diameter and depth to diameter ratio. Comparing the test data with the calculation results, several experimental formulae were proposed, which can determine the maximum lateral resistance and the corresponding displacement of pipeline both in sand and in soft clay. The proposed formulae are good to study lateral global buckling of submarine pipelines under thermal stresses."
"Resistivity logging data is crucial in reservoir evaluation. However, during the well drilling, it's difficult to obtain the true resistivity of the formation, which is due to the impact of mud invasion in permeable formations and its complex invasion mechanism and influencing factors. This affects the accuracy of reservoir divided, the identification of oil/gas/water zone and calculation of saturation. To solve this problem, the author conducted a experiment which is called ""Core Resistivity at Different Fracture Width Experiment"", then, combining the imaging and conventional logging data to study the resistivity response mechanism of mud invasion; ultimately, fitting the correction model for reservoir resistivity which is affected by the development of fracture. By comparing the results of the logging data interpretation, we found that the reservoir resistivity have been effectively corrected, furthermore, the oil saturation increased by 5.6% to 12%, the average increase reached 7.5%."
"The Qingdao Kiaochow Bay Subsea Tunnel was difficult because of complex geological conditions, including the 18 faults crossing the tunnel, large construction section, and high risks for collapse and water inrush. These conditions were considered as a background of this study. Geological disasters, such as collapse and water inrush, were introduced as the two main geological disasters during construction. Moreover, the advanced support pretreatment measures that aimed to address faults during construction and effectively prevented collapse disasters were introduced. For the water inrush disaster, geological forecasting was used to predict underground water location, and advanced grouting was adopted. The presented disaster control technologies were proven effective in the construction of the Qingdao Kiaochow Bay Subsea Tunnel. This study provides a certain reference value for disaster control technologies for subsea tunnel construction."

"The Ordos sand land is a typical sandy desertification area in northern China. Changes of soil organic matter and the combined humus in soil aggregate could be the index of soil desertification. The objectives of this study were: (i) to analyze the changes in soil organic carbon during the desertification process; (ii) to assess the distribution of soil combined humus and its changes in different aggregates. In this study, we selected the typical communities that represented a series of plant succession stages in the desertification process. Soil samples were collected from the plots under three successional plant communities and analyzed for total organic matter (SOM) under different degenerated gradients. We classified the aggregates into different groups and determined the combined humus in different size aggregates using the mechanical analysis method. The results showed that SOM decreased remarkably in surface soil (0-5 cm) from the steppe grass Stipa Bungeana to desert grass Cynanchum komorovii, during the desertification process. The fractions of soil combined humus were 36.63%, 28.84%, and 39.53% for loose combined humus, stable combined humus and tight combined humus with respectively average content. All fractions of soil combined humus carbon content decreased as the aggregate size decreased. In the desertification process at the Ordos sand land, the stable combined humus and tight combined humus decreased strongly in >50 mu m aggregate. The decreasing of humus carbon is mainly due to the losing of stable combined humus, especially in large size aggregates. With the development of the desertification, the soil organic carbon decreased with remarkable difference among different stages and the combined humus decreased with remarkable difference in different size aggregates among different stages."
"The East China Sea region in this paper mainly includes the continental shelf of East China Sea and Okinawa trough. The geological structure in the region basically belongs to the extension part of China's east mainland to the sea area. In Cenozoic, this area developed the East China Sea shelf basin, Diaoyu uplift fold zone, and Okinawa trough basin. Since East China Sea is located in the bonded zone of continental plate and the Philippines Sea plate, the neotectonics and the geological structure generated since the Middle Miocene are unique and complex. Basing on fully interpreting the related data and research achievements of previous researchers, this study profoundly analyzed and studied the characteristics of the neotectonics in East China Sea region from a perspective of tectonic landform, geological structure, and seismic activity etc. On this basis, it further discussed the dynamic conditions and seismic activity characteristics of neotectonics in East China Sea area."
"In this paper, the seismic response of the underground structures in the saturated soil is studied by ABAQUS, with the saturated soil being simulated by the pore pressure element based on the fluid-solid coupling dynamic formulation of fluid-saturated porous media. It is illustrated that by the end of the earthquake input, the value of Mises stress is maximal on the two bottom corners of the structure. The value of pore pressure and vertical displacement is large in the bottom area near the structure, and the value of pore pressure and vertical displacement is equal on two sides of the structure. The vertical displacement of the soil decreases with the increase of depth. The maximal seismic response occurs when the acceleration of the earthquake input is maximal."
"In order to reveal the formation mechanism of hydrochemical characteristics in Tongchuan City, we collected and detected 39 samples of underground water. Correlation analytical method, hydrochemical method and ion ratio coefficient method were employed to investigate the hydrochemical characteristics, influencing factors and principles of changing. Results demonstrate that the main factors, controlling the shallow water salinization, are the SO42-, NO3-, Cl- and K+. The contents of SO42-, NO3- and Cl- are in great differences and other indexes are in relatively stable. The values of gamma Na/gamma Cl demonstrate that the Na+ is released from the aquifer of soil in the process of runoff. There is an exchange between the Ca2+ in water and Na+ in soil, which leads to gamma Na>gamma Cl. As the exchange time in deep water is longer than that of shallow water, the exchange and adsorption of ions are more sufficient. The value of gamma Na/(gamma Na+gamma Cl) demonstrates that with the increasing of ground water depth, the level of cation exchange enhances, which leads to the dominant cation turns to Ca2+ from to Na+. The value of gamma HCO3+gamma SO4/gamma Ca+gamma Mg demonstrates the shallow water is mainly from atmospheric rainfall and the influence of cation exchange is more obvious on deep water. The types of shallow water in Tongchuan City are mainly HCO3 center dot SO4-Ca. Its classification is relatively complex. Whereas, the deep water is mainly HCO3-Na and the category of underground water is simple. As for shallow water, the contents of alkaline earth metal is larger that of alkali metal. For the deep water, the content of weak acid group is larger than that of strong acid group. In the region of upper reaches, the feature of both shallow water and deep water are mainly weak acid and alkaline earth metal. The chemical composition mainly consists of carbonate leaching. With the flowing of underground water, the shallow water turns to be strong acid and alkaline earth metal and the deep water turn to be weak acid and alkali metal."
"The relationship between microstructure and the mechanical properties of the X80 pipeline steels produced by an ultra fast cooling process was investigated using scanning and transmission electron microscopy and an energy dispersive spectrometer. Predominantly fine-grained acicular ferrite microstructure was obtained from the ultra fast cooling process. The developed X80 pipeline steel had low yield ratio and low temperature impact toughness. The ultra-fast cooling resulted in work hardened austenite before the phase transformation and also pushed the transformation to a lower temperature. Also, the Nb-Ti carbonitride precipitation was inhibited during ultra fast cooling. Therefore, the fine-grained microstructure and superior mechanical properties were attributed to grain refinement and the inhibiting of Nb-Ti carbontride precipitation, which was caused by ultra fast cooling."
"Marine oil and gas resources are very rich in China, especially in coastal zone and shallow sea continental shelf, but the exploration technology is relatively underdeveloped. The tectonic stress field is crucial to the study of tectonics, engineering, marine geology, seismology and the exploration of marine resources. In the exploration of marine resources, it is often necessary to study the mechanics and deformations of the rock in the oceanic crust. An iso-elevation line map of the fold's structural layer is a basic way to indicate the features and shapes of the fold, which is more important - especially in the field of exploratory marine petroleum engineering. To draw this map, though, requires a great deal of data, for structural profiles and drilling. It is very difficult to obtain these data, especially in mountainous regions or areas where mineral exploration has recently begun. This greatly limits the progress of marine exploratory engineering. In this paper, the author proposes a new theory and method for calculating the structural stress field using the composite quantitative data of remote sensing information on circular structures and related linear structures, in order to approximate the iso-elevation line map of local structures on the basis of the phase-separation analysis of remote sensing information field and the theory of elastic mechanics. The theory and method have been practically applied in many tested areas, and its effects are remarkable."
"The stability of rotors in high pressure multi-stage pumps used in the seawater desalination device is directly affected by the dynamical characteristics of water sliding bearings. Unsteady Reynolds equations for liquid films in sliding bearings, which were solved by adopting the narrow bearing theory and Gumbel boundary condidtions and the dynamical characteristic coefficients of sliding bearings, were calculated. Dynamical characteristics of water lubricated bearings with different bearing radius clearances and different eccentricities were studied using computational fluid dynamics and the optimized clearance was determined combining with rigidity and bearing capacity. Using ANSYS, the critical rotary speed under different modeling modes of bearing units was calculated, and the unbalance response and the integrated rigidity of the liquid film for water lubricated bearing were systematically analyzed, among which the latter was dimensionless. The results showed that the pressure and the rigidity initially became larger and then reduced with the increase of the thickness of the water film, while the bearing capacity became larger with the increase of eccentricities. The cross-coupling effects between rigidity and damping had evident influences on the calculating results of the critical rotary speed. The first order critical rotary speed satisfied the engineering design for rotor stability. The bearing B1 had more sensitive response to unbalance than the bearing B2 and for both water lubricated bearings B1 and B2, and there were keq>0, gamma st<0, judging from which the rotor system was stable and rigid. The results provided some references for improving the stable design of the system and the safe and reliable operation of rotor system with multistage pump."
"The installing of semi-submerged body under the bow can improve the longitudinal motion performance of the ship effectively, and the viscous damping generated by the semi-submerged body has great effect of reducing rocking. Considering the viscous damping, the hydrodynamic coefficients of the hull were calculated by means of RANS method in this paper. The hydrodynamic coefficients were calculated by 3-D method respectively and the influence of different turbulence models on the calculation results for hydrodynamic was discussed. The result was analyzed and compared with the one calculated by means of source/dipole mixed-distribution method. Besides, the calculation efficiency for the different meshing methods and turbulence models of the three dimensional RANS method was discussed. It was confirmed in this paper that the RANS method is applicable to obtain the hydrodynamic coefficients of the hull adding the semi-submerged body by calculations."
"With the increasing requirements of the hydrodynamic performance of the propeller, the optimization design of propeller has been gradually taken by people. With the DTRC series propellers as master model, this paper uses the theoretical prediction program based on surface panel method and combines with particle swarm optimization algorithm to study the optimization of propeller pitch (the other parameter is the same as the original propeller). In the optimization process, there are two different kinds of pitch expression (linear superposition method and Bezier function method) to fit radial distribution of pitch. With open water efficiency as the goal, the propeller is optimized and then discusses the influence of skew on open water efficiency. The result shows that Bezier method fits pitch curve more smoothly compared with hick-henne method, and that under the condition of meeting the thrust coefficient, the optimized propeller of Bezier method has higher open water efficiency."

The general mechanical structure of the clamp is designed to achieve the automatically closing and locking process of the clamp and especially to resolve the self-locking problem. Moreover, the maximum impact force of the clamp can be reduced by the speed optimization design of the hydraulic cylinders and effectively improve the clamp structural strength."
"Bucket foundations represent a new type of foundation for offshore wind turbines. They are large cylindrical structures that open at the base and close at the top. Compared with traditional offshore pile foundations, bucket foundations exhibit the advantages of shorter installation periods, lower material costs, and more rational bearing patterns. The complex interaction between a bucket foundation and soil defines the loading mechanism of this foundation type, and its failure mode has yet to be clearly defined. A simplified limit equilibrium method or other oil-platform design codes (e.g., API) is typically adopted to design bucket foundations. However, the simplified limit equilibrium method does not reflect the working characteristics of the soil in the foundation, thus resulting in a relatively considerable deviation. A numerical analysis is performed to simulate the working mechanism and evaluate the bearing capacity behavior of bucket foundations. Calculation results show that the bearing characteristics of bucket foundations are different from those of the simplified limit equilibrium method, and that failure occurs and develops in the soil within the bucket wall. This difference causes the simplified limit equilibrium method to overestimate the bearing capacity of bucket foundations."

"The maintenance cost of approach channel can be significantly reduced by utilizing the nautical bottom concept, in which the fluid mud layer is treated as a part of water depth. The positioning of nautical bottom mainly focuses on the mud's physical characteristics. Little attention is paid to the effect of fluid mud on the hydrodynamic performance of the ship. In this study, a commercial Reynolds averaged Navier-Stokes solver, FLUENT, is used to simulate flow field around a Wigley hull in shallow water with muddy seabed. The air-water and water-mud interfaces are captured by the volume of fluid method. The renormalization group k-epsilon model with enhanced wall treatment is employed for turbulence modeling. The constitutive relation of fluid mud is simulated by using the modified Herschel-Bulkley model. Based on the numerical simulation, the effects of forward speed and mud thickness on ship resistance and undulations of air-water and water-mud interfaces are investigated."

"The bucket foundation is one parts of offshore platform and is wearing the wave or wind loading which causes the bucket foundation instability to offshore platform falling, So, the numerical simulation, limit analysis and model test are investigated and compared in order to reveal the bearing capacity of bucket foundation under horizontal loading, Based on the three analysis methods compared, it can be observed that: (I) the results of the three methods are in good agreement. (2) The bucket foundation subjected to horizontal loading is rotation and the center of rotation is located in the two-thirds of embedded depth. Under horizontal load, the coherent spoon plastic zone is formed in the bottom of bucket foundation. And, the wedge plastic zone is formed on both sides of the bucket foundation. While, in the same direction with horizontal load of the barrel side is passive area and larger earth pressure is being because of barreling into foundation soil. On the other side of the foundation is active area, which the foundation is separation with soil."
"This paper investigates the tensile property of green high performance fiber reinforced cementitious composites (GHPFRCC) with focus on the influence of sample shape and mix proportion. Direct tensile tests are performed on the rectangle shaped plate coupons and dumbbell shaped ones, followed by sixteen kinds of mix proportions based on the orthogonal experiment method, considering such influencing factors as fly ash replacement by weight (60%, 65%, 70%, and 75%), water-binder ratio (0.24, 0.28, 0.32, and 0.36), sand-binder ratio(0.36, 0.46, 0.56, and 0.66), polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) fiber by volume (1.5%, 1.7%, 2.0%, and 2.2%) and water reducing agent by weight (0.10%, 0.15%, 0.20%, and 0.25%). And then, the tensile strength and ductility of GHPFRCC are highlighted and discussed. Experimental results show that the limit tensile deformation capacity of GHPFRCC is far better than that of the normal concrete. Water-binder ratio has a greater influence on the tensile strength and the optimal value is 0.24. GHPFRCC can obtain higher tensile strength when sand-binder ratio is 0.46. The limit tensile strength and deformation of the dumbbell shaped GHPFRCC specimens are usually better than those of the rectangle shaped plate coupons."
"The bearing capacity of offshore shallow foundations subjected to combined vertical, horizontal and moment loading is of interest particularly to the offshore geotechnical engineers. This paper reports a finite element (FE) study on the effects of strength anisotropy and foundation embedment depth on the combined bearing capacity. The Tresca failure criterion modified to allow for soil strength anisotropy and coupled with an elasto-perfectly plastic stress-strain relationship is assumed in the analysis which is conducted using the FE software ABAQUS. The undrained bearing capacities of shallow strip foundations under uniaxial vertical (V), moment (114) and horizontal (II) loadings are predicted and compared with available solutions. The V-111-H capacity of embedded foundations under combined loading is represented by failure envelopes in H-111 space for various vertical loading levels. The results presented in this paper show that the embedment ratio significantly affects the shape of the failure envelope expressed in terms of loads normalized by the pure moment or pure horizontal load-carrying capacity of the foundation. However, the shape of failure envelope defining the undrained capacity of shallow foundations under horizontal and moment loads is independent of soil strength anisotropy."
"This paper mainly analyzes the optimal anchorage length of a straight-laid inshore pipeline. To begin with, several ways of how to fix a pipe are ticked off, and the way with discontinuous anchor is chosen for the specific analysis. Mathematical model is built to analyze the stress state of the pipeline, which is fixed with the screw anchor, and the main failure mode of pipeline-excessive-yield-failure mode-is checked; thus we gain the maximum anchorage distance of the pipeline. To get a more exact result, a finite element model of the pipeline is built. With the software ANSYS, the model is analyzed under wave conditions. The results reveal that the maximum anchorage distance differ in different determinants, namely distance, stress and strain; the stress of the pipeline first exceeds the allowable range when anchorage distance increases."
"Elevated pile-cap foundation is one of the most popular foundation types for offshore wind turbines. Form selection and design are the keys in the construction of offshore wind farms. Because offshore wind turbines are high-rise structures, a reasonable and applicable foundation can ensure the normal operation of wind turbines. Meanwhile, it can decrease the size of foundation and reduce the cost of construction effectively. Four types of pile group foundations named BPG-type, SPG-type, VPG-type, and CPG-type are developed. Combined with laboratory model experiments, a numerical simulation method is established and verified in this paper. The vertical bearing capacity, horizontal bearing capacity and bending bearing capacity are studied comparatively with the numerical simulation method. Combined with practical engineering, the applicability of the foundations is evaluated. The results indicate that BPG-type and SPG-type have the stronger vertical bearing capacity, horizontal bearing capacity and bending bearing capacity than VPG-type and CPG-type in the same amount of steel. In addition, batter piles can effectively increase the bearing capacity of pile foundations. The VPG-type needs to increase the size of foundation to meet the requirements of wind turbine operation. In practical engineering, the combination of vertical piles and batter piles can increase the bearing capacity of pile group foundations and decrease the cost of construction."
"The meander river has one of the most common types of natural river morphology, where the flow pattern influences the transformation and development of river morphology. The theory of the instability analysis of laminar flow in a wide-shallow meander channel with constant curvature is investigated in this study. The modified Orr-Summerfield equation, which is established in a curvilinear orthogonal coordinate for two-dimensional incompressible flow, is simplified for the case of wide-shallow channel. The characteristics of instability, such as the neutral curve of critical Reynolds number, contour of growth rate and characteristic spectrum of wave number are obtained by performing the numerical simulations. The computed results show that the characteristic spectrum of meander channel is similar to that of straight channel. It can thus be inferred that the flows in both channels have the same stability characteristics. Furthermore, the neutral curve moves leftward and the critical Reynolds number decreases with the increase of bank curvature. Secondly, the response to the disturbance wave number also increases, which results in the instability of the flow. Thus, this study explains the reasons for the laminar flow becoming unstable in meander channel and also establishes the fundamental theory to further study meandering rivers."

Phenomena such as ice failure model and velocity changes of icebreaker are shown in simulation results, which show that the simulated ice loads are in good agreement with the literature results. The method presented in this paper can reflect the stress distribution of the structure and the numerical model can be applied to predict ice load and structure strength."

By using the refined finite element model established, the failure mechanism and distribution of skin friction acting on the outer wall of monopile is evaluated."
"To simplify the modeling and improve calculating efficiency of wind turbine blade, properties equivalent method of composite laminate based on strain energy method is put forward. To take representative volume element of composite as research object, basing on the two-dimension strain energy method, the equations set, which shows the relationship between equivalent stiffness matrix coefficient of composite properties and strain energy of RVE, is deduced on the three-dimension strain energy method through utilizing strain energy conservation theory and transforming of different strain energy formula. And the equation set is in accordance with the stress and strain field of RVE is the same as that of homogeneous equivalent unites under certain conditions. Then energy expression of properties equivalent stiffness matrix for composite is given. Turning the stiffness matrix into compliance matrix, the equivalent properties parameters of composite laminated plate can be obtained. Additionally, properties equivalent algorithm is applied to tri-axial composite laminated plate [0, 45], and the calculating results are agreed with the measured ones. Meanwhile, properties equivalence along the longitudinal and thickness direction of 1.5 MW blade is done respectively. After comparing the results of structural analysis of the blade root for layered element model and equivalent model, the feasibility and effectiveness of the proposed algorithm can be well proved."
"Waste materials that are generated in large quantities, such as waste rubbers, plastics, and dredged soils, can potentially be reused as fill materials in construction projects. It will bring both economical and environmental benefits. This paper firstly presents a review on different methods of reusing scrap tires and waste soils in constructions. Then, a new method of using these two wastes as a fill material is proposed and experimentally evaluated. The material is formed by mixing waste soils, scrap tire chips, Portland cement, and water together in varying proportions. Isotropic compression and triaxial consolidated undrained compression tests were carried out. The geotechnical properties of the material with varying additions of different components are investigated. It is found that adding more tire chips in the material leads to an evident improvement in the undrained strength; while the compressibility of the specimens with 0-60% tire chips content (to dry soil by weight) does not change very much. The test results also manifest that increasing cement content is an effective way to reduce the compressibility and improve the undrained strength, indicating that the mechanical behavior of the material can be well controlled by adjusting the cement addition. Thanks to its advantageous features such as small compressibility and adjustable strength, the material is suitable for quaywall backfill and embankment fill in port or transportation constructions."
"Energy is the essential pillar of the national economy. Either the shortage or the interruption of energy will directly threaten the security of our national economy,. With the rapid development of our national economy, especially the increasing dependence on marine energy transportation, sea lanes security gradually becomes a strategic issue concerning national security and development. At present, over 90% of the national imported energy supplement depends on the marine transportation. Thus, the sea lane is becoming the ""blood vessels"" to sustain the national economy.

"The real impact of water or waves on coastal and ocean engineering infrastructures is anticipated to be significant. It is a complicated problem to couple a deformable structure with an air water fluid flow. The paper studies the slamming pressure and hydroelastic vibration of a flat plate by a series of drop tests. The peak pressure and related air-water status are recorded simutaneously. Part of the real physical field is revealed for future numerical model of strong interaction with fluid-solid system. It is found that a thin layer of air, which is enclosed by water raised up at both ends, is trapped into the interface of the plate and water. The peak pressure occurs at the plate center and keeps steady in repetitive tests. Hydroelastic vibration, which was stimulated by impacting load, makes the pressure to decrease periodically in a turbulent air-water field. Characteristic frequency of pressure signals agrees with the wet modes of the plate."

Compared to the existing resampling algorithm, the proposed algorithm can maintain the diversity of particles and avoid the sample impoverishment in particle filtering, thus increase the estimation accuracy. Simulation results show that the accuracy of tracking small target in low signal-to-noise ratio optimal image sequence is increased in terms of the quantitative criteria-RMSE."

"South Korea Sewol ferry accident was analyzed based on behavior-based accident causation ""2-4"" model. The direct behavioral causes of this tragedy were Captain Lee's absence on the bridge in the dangerous range of sailing and a sudden turn made by Park Han-kyul. The important cause of the accident for further expansion was Captain Lee's false command. He didn't get passengers ready for evacuation in the first time. Another important causes leading to the accident were the overloading of cargo and the lack of ballast water on board. The decisive causes of the accident were the defects about Chonghaejin Marine Company's safety management system and safety culture, such as the lack of training and safety investment. Measures should be taken to provide similar accidents from governments, supervision departments, marine companies and schools."

"The shipping market is always in volatility according to complex impact factors. This paper develops a new operational early warning system (EWS) model based on the economy cycle theory for predicting shipping market crises. To achieve this goal this paper analyses and extends the early warning system by constructing the ""climate index"".

However, with the decline of external demand in recent years and the reconstruction of China's economy, it has promoted that the competition among the various shipping companies become increasingly fierce. This paper applies the game theory to the container port in the enterprise. Through analyzing the interest among container ports, some suggestions are put forward to promote the development of the container ports."
"Dry ports have become integral to the trade facilitation in China in the last decade. They are playing important roles in facilitating transportation for international trade and further stimulating economic development in China's central and western inland areas. However, without a clear strategic direction, the institutional and regulatory framework for dry port development is shown to be at an immature and disordered state. This paper summarizes the current status of dry port development in China. Based on this, the study proposes a new dry port development strategic layout. We conclude that the dry port development strategy in China should be shifted from the pursuit of scale to efficiency. We also point out that, in order to avoid repetitive or blind construction, the dry ports' construction plan should be integrated into the layout of the port construction planning and comprehensive transportation system planning. The governors of dry ports should have a better understanding about the trend of the dry ports development in the world. For a long-term interest, we need to absorb investment through different ways to alleviate the capital pressure. By strengthening the cooperation relationships among the local governments, customs, inspection and quarantine departments, and the logistics enterprises, an innovative service mode should be built to create the value for the enterprises. Our study could shed light on the practice of port enterprises to improve quality service for winning more customers' trust and satisfaction. The strategic directions of dry port in China are also well discussed in our study."

"This paper presents vortex-induced vibration (VIV) and fatigue analysis of deep-water risers in shear flow considering parametric excitations due to the heave of floating platform. As a first step, the governing equation of transverse motion of the riser is established; the dynamic response of the riser is calculated numerically by the finite difference method based on Van der Pol wake-oscillator model. Then the fatigue damage of the riser is obtained by applying Miner cumulative damage theory and S-N curve. The results show that the VIV response of the riser, especially in the flow with low speed, is much larger due to the parametric excitation. The bending stress and the fatigue damage at the bottom of the riser are significantly increased under parametric excitations."
"It is necessary to control pollution of the marine environment while improving coastal economy for sustainable developing. But it is difficult to evaluate ocean's changing because of its openness. So the ocean environment performance was proposed in this paper. Combined with data envelopment analysis and product efficiency theory, the static and dynamic methods for measuring the performance were first constructed. In order to analyze the actual situation of Chinese coastal cities and verify the effectiveness of the two methods, the static and dynamic ocean environment performance for Chinese 16 coastal cities were evaluated with these methods. By comparing the actual pollution in the sea area near these cities, the calculated results showed the index and the models designed in this paper can better reflect the effect of the economy to the coastal marine environment. Based these results, more comparing analysis for these cities was further analyzed. It is useful for their sustainable development."
"Taiwan is surrounded by sea areas, ecological, cultural, and economic and maritime industries are closely related, and Taiwan coastline of 1319 km. Gravity buildings suitable for coastal and nearshore shallow waters, such as Haiti, revetments, piers, breakwaters, artificial islands, so as to soil, stone, concrete and other materials built into the slope, straight wall or hybrid type of structure, marine engineering industry is a long cycle, capital-intensive, technology-intensive, labor-intensive traditional industries. Taiwan's first engineering and coastal waters can be traced back in 1960 to build the Taichung Harbor, Suao harbor, Hualien, Kaohsiung and Keelung of building expansion, the Taiwan Power Company's various nuclear and thermal power plants. The Coastal Enterprises seeks to demonstrate the capabilities of the individuals job seeker, not focus on their disability. Based on the findings of past studies, many factors affect job seekers in terms of applying to work for SMEs. That is, external factors, job seekers' backgrounds, and enterprise related factors are all likely to affect job seekers' attitudes towards an enterprise; job seekers could also be affected by referent groups, and the effects of individual abilities. In order to summarize the many possible impact factors in a structured manner, this research uses the theory of planned behavior as its theoretical framework. This study also obtained the opinions of 320 respondents from the coastal engineering job fair held in Taiwan, and the results found that attitudes and perceived behavioral control are the main considerations affecting coastal engineering job seekers applying for SMEs' job vacancies. This research also proposes related research suggestions based on the research results."
"Sea ice infests the Bohai Bay every winter. Normally, ice condition is slight but sometimes heavy ice conditions may occur. It has been difficult for offshore designers to determine the conditions and the ice loads. Two jackets were pushed over by ice and others were designed too conservative as ice load were overestimated. In recent years some of the platforms have met severe ice induced vibrations, which has caused harmful accidents. In this paper, sea ice problems in oil and gas exploitation of Bohai Bay are briefly introduced. The dynamic behavior of ice resistant jacket structures and the potential failure modes that arise from cyclic ice actions are described."
"Typically, trenchless drilling rig is used in cable laying in power system. Then through the windlass; the cable is pulled into the pipeline. Although the size of the pull-back force is very important to calculate the pull-back force in cable laying, the existing calculation equation for pull-back force is targeted at pull-back force in pipeline laying. This article analyzes the frequently-used calculation equations and its service condition in pipeline laying. And a pull-back force test instrument in cable laying is designed, by which a large number of pull-back force of cable laying in practical engineering project is collected. Through the comparison of the measured values and calculation values by the equation for pull-back force, it is founded that the equation for pull-back force in pipeline laying is suitable for the calculation of pull-back force in cable laying in case that it multiplied by a certain coefficient."
"Accurate simulation of the flow field around the hull is of great significance to predict hydrodynamic performances of a submarine. Judging by the resistance of the hull, researchers will be able to know whether the flow field was finely simulated. In this paper, LES (Large-Eddy Simulation) is used to predict the resistance and wake of a standard submarine model DARPA SUBOFF at a high Reynolds number of 2.65 x 10(7). The results of the simulation were analyzed in detail and compared with the experimental data; they showed satisfactory agreement with the experimental data both quantitatively and qualitatively."
"Towards the weakness of BP neural network, an efficient PSC ship-selecting model combining improved PSO and SVM algorithm is developed in this paper. The scheme is validated by demonstration analysis of actual data from ""THETIS"" Inspection Database that the accuracy is 97.619%, while the time complexity is reduced efficiently. This PSC ship-selecting model is very suitable for the scenario of limited inspect resources for rapid ship classification, which certainly has much great significance for PSC targeting."
"For improving the attitude accuracy using the lower cost and lower power underwater navigation system, this paper proposes the new underwater navigation system which is composed of the inertial sensors aided with the magnetometer, and the unscented Kalman filter based on smooth variable algorithm (UKF-SV) is proposed to improve the attitude accuracy for the underwater glider. The UKF-SV makes use of the advantage of UKF (unscented Kalman filter) in the nonlinear model to estimate attitudes and then smoothes the variables estimated by UKF. Through this process, the attitude accuracy can be greatly improved. The convergence of UKF-SV is proven in theory. The static and dynamic experiments are done to assess the performance of UKF-SV and compare with the traditional UKF. The experiment results show that the performance of UKF-SV is better than the traditional UKF."

After the propeller model was completed, basic ship operation such as start, stop and emergency astern are simulated with the help of mathematical model of the ship-propeller. Through analyzing the change curves of the revolution speed of the propeller, the navigation speed of the ship and the torque of the ship under all kinds of working conditions, some operable suggestions and theory evidences are provided for the practical operation of the ship."
"Missing sensor data is a challenge in wireless sensor network (WSN) for marine environmental monitoring, which may lower the performance of WSN. Therefore, estimation of the missing sensor data has received growing attention in WSN recently. In this paper we propose a novel data estimation approach based on Node Clustering and Genetic Programming (NCGP) to estimate the missing sensor data for WSN. NCGP consists of node clustering module and data estimation module. We first set up clusters according to data similarity and spatial similarity in the node clustering module, and then in the data estimation module, Genetic Programming is applied to mine the relationship among the nodes in the same cluster. Our proposed approach can efficiently retrieve the missing data by the help of the historical round reading and/or current round reading depend on the number of the nodes in the data missing cluster. The experiments have demonstrated the efficacy of NCGP in terms of five error statistics, wave plot and scatter plot compared to the existing techniques."
"Virtual prototype technology has been widely applied to simulate the performance of various complex mechanical systems. However, errors existing in analysis models usually cannot be ignored, particularly rigid-flexible coupling dynamics model, so many parameters factors have to be considered and to be improved.

The scatter degree of the simulation results of the revised impact dynamics model has better consistency with the test results, and the validity of the virtual prototype model is improved."
"Aimed to monitor spatial pattern of sea areas reclamation in Liaoning province. Series satellite remote sensing images obtained from 1990 to 2010 were employed to monitor sea areas reclamation and coastline change in coastal zone of Liaoning. Some spatial index was established to describe sea areas reclamation and coastline change by geographical information system, respectively. The results are as follow: Spatial index based on geographical information system are suitable to assess spatial pattern of sea areas reclamation and coastline change. The sea areas reclamation in coastal zone of Liaoning is 35,720.98 hm(2) from 1990 to 2010. The sea areas reclamation intension is high in Panjin and Jinzhou with reclamation intension index above 90.0 hm(2)/km, but low in Huludao, Yingkou and Dalian with reclamation intension index below 20.0 hm(2)/km. Length of coastline in Liaoning increased and its tortuosity ascend over last 20 years. The increment is 30% in some regions as Jinzhou and Panjin. Exploitation of coastline cause the growth of the length of artificial coastline (dams, bulwark, e.g.), while natural coast line (rock coastline, sandy coastline and muddy coastline) is compressed."
"With the development of marine surveying technology, there is an urgent need for solving the discontinuity problem of the depth datum.

"In order to study the Automatic Collision-Avoidance (ACA) actions of vessels in head-on situation in accordance with rules of International Regulation for Preventing Collision at Sea (COLREGS 72) and ordinary practice of seaman, stags of vessel's meeting process were separated by Collision Risk Index (CRI) and Time to Immediate Danger (TID). The reason to correct Collision-Avoidance (CA) actions at different stages are different. CRI and TID were derived from defined Situation Elements (SE) in head -on situation. Then computing models of them and ACA actions at different stages were presented. The basis of this research is the center moved ship's elliptical domain theories and MMG three-free dimensional digital model which is calculated by ship's hydrodynamic equations. The following is proved by simulations: The mathematic models presented ensure rapid and reliable convergence of SE computing; new CRI model is much more in line with the thinking process of navigators and practice at sea than before; ACA actions in accordance with COLREGS rules and ordinary practice of seaman, can be produced by program. The research may make big improvement to the final achievement of ACA of ship in head-on situation."

"Submarine pipelines are exposed to the risk of damage from dragged anchors of ships that lose control during severe storms. Rock armor berms are commonly employed to protect the pipelines by deflecting the dragged anchors. Theoretical work and model tests are implemented in this study to understand the protection mechanism provided by rock berms. A limit equilibrium method is proposed to address the interaction between the dragged Hall anchor and the developed soil wedges. The total drag force on the anchor is obtained as the sum of the drag force on the anchor crown and that on the anchor fluke. Model tests are performed with three model anchors with different linear scales. The drag forces measured in the model tests agree well with those calculated by the theoretical approach. Results show that when the anchor is dragged into the rock armor berm from the soil foundation, an unbalanced moment is induced on the anchor; this moment causes the dragged anchor to rotate and the fluke tip to rise up. Such prediction may be helpful to berm designers."
"The hydrodynamic drag force of fractal flocs during settling is examined by the Lattice Boltzmann method. Fractal flocs formed by Diffusion-Limited Aggregation (DLA) and diffusion-limited-cluster-cluster aggregation (DLCCA) models settle down in the quiescent water and drag forces are directly calculated. The numerical simulations are consistent with the analytical results. The ratio of drag force on fractal flocs and floc size shows a linear relationship with the floc settling velocity when the flow filed around the flocs is Stokes flow. The drag coefficient experienced by flocs is significantly different from the spheres. Moreover, drag forces on flocs formed by DLCCA are larger than flocs formed by DLA, when the flocs are composed of the same primary particles."
"The cavernous reservoir has become one of the main carbonate reservoirs for stable and increasing production. The degrees and the types of fillings materials are the key factors which affect the characteristics of accumulation and flowage. However, due to the complexity of fillings in the caves, the response laws of logging of the cavernous reservoir can not be understood clearly and its effective evaluation has been severely hampered. This paper uses for the first time numerical simulation to study the responses in the curve of dual lateral log of cavernous reservoir. By establishing a continuous equation of the dual lateral log and its boundary factors and using the electric field superimpose principle, a finite element method is used to study the cave size, different filling agents and degrees are simulated. The result indicates that the size, filling agents and degrees show a clear response, and they have a clear correspondence. Summarizing and analyzing the response laws on the dual lateral logging curves of the cavernous reservoir can provide theoretical evidence for the logging evaluation of the carbonate cavernous reservoir."
"To solve unpunctual delivery, low assembly line utilization and unbalanced production in the assembly shop scheduling of an automotive electronic components enterprise, the model of multi-model multiple assembly line mixed-lines assembling by turns was constructed and the model was solved by designing a series of optimal algorithms. In view of meeting the punctual delivery period, improving the utilization of assembly lines and the order fulfillment rate, the scheduling model was constructed different from the majority of similar models. The virtual sequence, a new neighborhood structure to avoid the adjustment in cycling improvement, was defined and combined with the scheduling rules and heuristics strategy to design three algorithms for solving the model. The performance of presented algorithms were analyzed and compared with the original scheduling results. The performance comparison results demonstrate the virtual tabu (Vtr-Tabu) algorithm can apply in the small and medium scale scheduling problem with better performance than other two. And the performance variation curves of three algorithms with the increasing of single parameter were analyzed. The computational results verify the effectiveness of the presented model and algorithms in improving delivery, the assembly line utilization and the order fulfillment rate."
"The carrier angular motion and disturbance torque are the two main problems limiting stable accuracy of the line of sight (LOS) of airborne optical stabilized platform. Angular rate isolation and torque stiffness analysis of the servo system are proposed to improve the stable accuracy. A PII2 control scheme is taken to obtain fast response, low overshot and zero steady-state error. In order to achieve higher target tracking precision compared with PII2 scheme, a feed forward compensation has been presented against the low tracking accuracy problems caused by pure lag of the system image tracking instruction. Simulation results indicate that the servo system designed has strong capability of isolating angular movement and disturbance torque. Tracking accuracy of the stabilized platform servo control system can be efficiently improved when appropriate feed forward control is introduced."
"Dynamic evolution model and critical failure criterion of the instability evolution for submarine tunnel system are studied in this paper. Based on the synergetic theory and chaotic dynamic theory, nonlinear dynamics evolution characteristics for the whole process of the tunnel deformation and instability are presented. The fluctuation correlation mechanism of the whole tunnel system is revealed by systematical analysis, and then the nonlinear dynamic evolution model is established. Combined the practice project with the length of time sequence for general deformation monitoring data as well as the effective analysis on chaotic dynamics, the dynamical criterion of the stability evolution process of the tunnel system is conducted separately under different data conditions (more than 3,000 and less than 3,000). According to unstable and failure features of each evaluating stage of the tunnel system, the dynamic criterion is proposed. It provides a significant guideline for the calculation and analysis of submarine tunnel stability."

"Sailing routes is the basis of carrier's survival, the planning of route network is the strategic for the carrier. Optimization theory of hub and spoke network is a highly simplified result in specific constraints of the network composed by the given nodes, so the theory plays little roll in the actual network planning. According to the complex network theory, we establish the route network design model with the constraints of investment limit, non-strict, capacitated and multiple allocation, the aim of model is to minimum the total cost of the route opened cost, the transportation cost, the hub node construction cost, the opportunity cost caused by the not yet been transported; secondly, to study the ILNS-CMAHLP problem based on the Mixed Set Programming (MSP) theory, we make the data model with the set variables, give the logic model to express the relation among input variables, output variables and decision variables, build the solve rule based on the set reasoning algorithm. Finally, we calculate the ILNS-CMAHLP exact solution of NCL language in the POEM optimization platform. Results show that the NCL algorithm, which has the natural modeling and mixed set programming features, is a useful tool to solute the constraints of joint solving of NP-Hard problem, and it will avoid the combination explosion problem of large-scale integer programming; at the same time, it will open the new research direction for the optimization of hub and spoke network with the capacitated etc. constraints, it can provide theoretical guidance and technical support for the actual route network planning."
"Strategy of sea-rail combined transport greatly save logistics costs and promote economy of port. High efficiency integrated sea-rail transport depend on safety operation of railway. So, high-speed railway safety plays a prominent role for booming of future transport development. Since high-speed railways on moving is characterized by complexity, prediction technique about traffic safety in existence is impossible to predict reliably safety of highspeed rail. This paper puts forward a new forecasting method about high-speed train's safe operation based on analyzing the main factors of influencing high-speed railway's safe operation. The fuzzy logic model of forecast to high-speed railway's safe operation is established in this method which is based on building object set, factor set and judgment set. In addition, fuzzy assessment function is applied to judge safety of high-speed railway in real time and assessment indicators is offered. Coastal Economy and Development could be accelerated when fuzzy assessment function was introduced into coastal high-speed railway construction. Experimental results show that this method can effectively forecast safety of high-speed train on moving and provides an effective guarantee for it"
"The port strategic alliance partner selection is a decision problem, this article introduces an approach to partner selection with grey target model. Currently, researches concerning with interval number grey target multi-attribute group decision making (MAGDM) still have low precision of attribute weight interval, unscientific determination of expert weight and unreasonable optimality sorting of decision targets. Focusing on above problems, a grey target MAGDM analysis method based on error propagation and vertical projection distance is proposed. In this method, we determine the attribute weight interval by using the error propagation model proceeding from the error angle of view of the interval number attribute value. Subsequently, we collect the decision making information provided by all group decision makers according to the off-target deviation degree theory. Moreover, we establish an optimization model of decision maker weight at the purposes of minimizing the vertical projection distance, and simultaneously provide the optimality sorting by calculating the vertical projection distance between each scheme and the ideal scheme. Finally an example of selecting port strategic alliance partner is used to verify the feasibility and validity of the method."
"Constructed wetland is one of the main ways to improve the water quality. Vegetation is the important group of the ecological system for improving the water quality in Constructed wetland. And the vegetation are obtained generally from seeds. Carex lasiocarpa is a widely distributed species of wetland plants, and it is a dominant species in the SanJiang wetlands. However, its seed is difficult to germinate - this study was conducted to determine effective methods for enhancing germination. The germination percentage, germination initiation time and germination period of C. lasiocarpa seeds were significantly improved by soaking seeds in various concentrations of potassium nitrate or sodium hydroxide (NaOH). The maximum germination percentage (70%)(V/V) was obtained by pre-treatment of seed by immersing in 10% NaOH for 60 min, followed by 30/20 degrees C (this is the temperature suitable for germination). Higher germination rate contributes to the wetland plants for breeding, it is significance to realize the function of Constructed wetland."
"The pile-running frequently occurs because of the great weights of both the pile and the hammer. Thepile-running mechanism is super long and large-diameter piles are commonly used for constructing ocean platform foundations. Pile-runningdiscussed in the current studythrough case analyses. Apredictingprocedure is developed based on the limit equilibrium of pile weight and soil resistance. Reduction factors for soil strength used to calculate the skin friction arealso suggested in the current study. The Berezantsev approach is recommended for calculating the end bearing resistance to the running pile, which can improve the precision of the estimation compared with that of commonly used methods. The suggested method is used to predict the pile-running case in a practical project, and the calculated results are consistent with the driving records."

"The rate at which coastal sea level is expected to rise or fall is of considerable interest to coastal residents and managers who view changes on the time scale of a 30-year mortgage. Analysis of historical records at North American tide stations provides evidence of recent nonlinear sea-level change at this scale using relative mean sea-level (RMSL) observations. RMSL tracks local inundation risk directly without the need to correct an accepted worldwide geocentric measure e.g., global mean sea-level rise with locally estimated vertical rate adjustments. Published RMSL linear trends provide essential information but are routinely compared between tide stations with widely varying record lengths, thereby obfuscating nonlinear change (acceleration or deceleration) over a specific period of time. Here monthly averaged RMSL data from 45 U.S. tide stations and one Canadian tide station are analyzed from 1969 through 2014, extending a definitive period of acceleration previously noted along the U.S. NE Coast. Using a Bayesian approach to determine the joint probability of paired regression parameters for RMSL quadratic trends, probabilities for forward projections to the year 2050 based on these trends suggest continued sea-level rise will be aided by acceleration presently on the order of 0.1 to 0.2 mm/y(2) in the U.S. NE and Gulf Coast regions. Deceleration ranging from -0.1 to -0.4 mm/y(2) is likely to reinforce falling sea levels at specific locations on the U.S. West Coast in the near term."
"The western Caribbean Basin is notable for its tectonic stability. It has experienced no historical earthquakes or the tsunami that sometimes accompany them. This paper describes a single, wedge-shaped, boulder-covered, coastal berm on the Yucatan coast of Mexico that stretches unbroken for 50 km across a coastal segment characterized by rocky headlands that alternate with crescent beaches. The remainder of the 350 km of Yucatan coast consists mostly of mangrove that extends 1 to 30 km inland, often behind long, sandy beaches. On the headlands, the surface of the berm is densely paved with boulders large boulders on its seaward face and smaller boulders and cobbles on its gently sloping inland surface. The top of the berm reaches an elevation >4 m, above the reach of all but the largest modern storm waves. Berm sediments on the headlands consist of two distinct layers of unbedded coarse sand with numerous randomly distributed boulders and cobbles in the lower layer and a crudely textured gravel and sand layer above. At first glance the two layers appear to be separated by 20 cm of white sand above a thin, discontinuous zone of dark, greyish sand that contains isolated balls and smears of black organic material, apparently derived from a soil, or possibly leaf litter. The berm and its associated boulders track the modern coastal morphology in precise detail as it follows the form of modern headlands, bays, and transcoastal channels, indicating that deposition took place after development of the present coast. The berm sediments record two or three large waves, depending on whether the wave that deposited the boulder pavement is regarded as part of the second wave or as a separate wave. Radiocarbon dating indicates that at least one wave struck the coast approximately 1500 years before present. Minimum wave run-up exceeds 4 m above present sea level, and inland inundation reached 400 m along bays and transcoastal channels. The position and elevation of the berm, its lack of well-developed internal bedding, the paving of the berm surface by thousands of boulders, and its 400-m extent inland along channels and bays are features commonly associated with tsunami. However, some recent studies conclude that all of the features listed also can be produced by mega-hurricanes. Placed in the context of our literature search of the recent history of hurricanes and tsunami in the Caribbean Basin, we conclude that the single berm on the Yucatan coast represents an anomalous event for this area and that the berm sediments bear a strong similarity to descriptions of sediments from some historical tsunami and are unlike sedimentary features associated with historical hurricanes."
"The San Francisco and Monterey Bay coastal dune sheets derive from similar origins in the central California coast but differ substantially in size (respectively, similar to 400 and similar to 900 km(2)) and age (respectively, <0.1 and >1.0 Ma). The San Francisco dune sheet is restricted to a short alongshore interval (<20 km) within a relatively straight coastline (150 km in length) that borders a broad shelf (similar to 40 km in width). The Monterey Bay dune sheet is restricted to the Monterey Bay embayment (41 km alongshore length). The embayment includes a very narrow shelf (3-15 km in width), which is dissected by the Monterey Submarine Canyon. Generally low onshore topographic relief (<150 m elevation) likely enhanced inland transgression of Late Pleistocene dune fields in both the San Francisco and Monterey Bay areas. The locations of the dune sheets are directly related to sand accumulations in marine low-stand depocenters that supplied sand to the adjacent dune fields by eolian transport across the emerged inner shelves. The San Francisco shelf depocenter is apparently localized at a midshelf bight (-50 to -100 m elevation) that extends 25 km (east-west) offshore of a paleoriver mouth of a major river system, the Sacramento-San Joaquin River. The Monterey Bay shelf depocenter is bounded alongshore by major headlands and converging paleoshorelines (-30 to -90 m elevation) that effectively trapped littoral sand from small coastal drainages, primarily the Salinas River. High vertical rates of neotectonic deformation in the San Francisco dune sheet (0.4-1.0 mm y(-1)) limited dune sheet longevity and deposit thickness (5-35 m). Low uplift rates (similar to 0.1 mm y(-1)) in the central Monterey Bay dune sheet permitted deposit accumulations of up to 250 m thickness. The differences in dune sheet extent, thickness, and age resulted from key differences in localized shelf accommodation space and coastal neotectonic vertical movements."
"Ammophila breviligulata Fern. (American beachgrass) is planted extensively along the Atlantic coast of North America and in the Great Lakes region to stabilize damaged and constructed coastal dunes. Most A. breviligulata restorations are planted with a single cultivar for rapid dune stabilization. Restoration practice, however, is increasingly focused on maintaining native genetic diversity and restoring ecological services and function. We used intersimple sequence repeat (ISSR) markers to characterize the genetic structure of four native and four restored A. breviligulata populations along the coast of New Jersey on the northeastern Atlantic coast of the United States. Native populations had high levels of genotypic diversity for a clonal species, whereas restored populations on constructed dunes had low diversity or were monotypic. Commercial varieties used in dune restoration were not found in native populations. Native foredune populations were composed of many small- to medium-sized clones, while a rear-dune population was dominated by a single large clone. Genetic differentiation was low among native foredune populations. These results, discussed in the context of other clonal and coastal dune species, suggest that sexual recruitment plays an important role in determining the genetic structure of A. breviligulata populations, that gene flow has occurred among populations along the New Jersey coast, and that native New Jersey populations could provide genotypically diverse plant material for local restoration efforts."
"Accurate determination of the critical shear stress associated with the erosion and deposition of sediments is an important component of numerical models used to predict and quantify sediment behavior and transport across intertidal flats. In this study, water depth, wave parameters, near-bed turbulent velocity, suspended sediment concentration (SSC), and intratidal bed-level changes were measured to determine the erosion (tau(ce)) and deposition (tau(cd)) thresholds of sediments on an intertidal mudflat at Jiangsu, China. Based on integrated field measurements of bed-level changes and hydrodynamics, the bed shear stresses of currents (tau(c)), waves (tau(w)), and combined current-wave action (tau(cw)) were calculated, and the critical shear stress required for erosion (tau(ce) = 0.14 N/m(2)) and deposition (tau(cd) = 0.08 N/m(2)) of these sediments was determined. Both values are in agreement with an estimate of tau(ce) (0.13 N/m(2)) that was based on water content and tau(cd) values calculated by previous works, indicating that the value of tau(ce) estimated for these sediments is controlled primarily by the water content of the sediments. During field measurements, deposition occurred (tau(cw) < tau(cd)) when current action exceeded wave energy (tau(c) > tau(w)) during calm weather, whereas erosion occurred (tau(cw) > tau(ce)) when wave action increased dramatically during rough weather. Our field data showed that high current velocities lead to low tau(c), possibly because high SSC reduced the drag coefficient, which is variable during a tide, and further caused low tau(c) under high current velocities. Additionally, bedforms characteristic of intertidal mudflat (e.g., gullies, small creeks, ripples, or saltmarsh) has a significant influence on the drag coefficient of the bed. These observations suggest that the bed level responds strongly to changing hydrodynamic conditions, and also that waves are of great importance to erosion. This study demonstrates that the in situ determination of the parameters that control erosion and deposition is a useful approach to obtaining values of tau(ce) and tau(cd), which provide the basis for a mechanistic understanding of the morphological evolution and development of predictive sediment transport and erodibility models."
"A dredging project in the Pearl River estuary would influence the topography, water dynamics, and mass transport process. The effects of dredging in the channel of the Pearl River estuary on tidal range and saltwater intrusion were studied using a hydrodynamic model (finite volume coastal ocean model) and historical water depth data. The measured data showed that the tidal range decreased and saltwater intrusion increased in the North River. The tidal range increased and saltwater intrusion decreased in the West River in recent decades from the 1980s. The simulations in this study showed that after dredging (1) the upstream flow split ratio in the river changed (i.e. more freshwater flowed through the Sanshui station), whereas less freshwater flowed through the Makou station; (2) the tidal range increased in the West River network and decreased in the downstream reaches of the North River network; and (3) the saltwater intrusion increased in the West River mouths and weakened in the North River mouths. These results agreed with the observed phenomenon. The change in the flow split ratio between the North River and the West River induced by dredging was the fundamental dynamic that caused changes in both the tidal range and saltwater intrusion in the Pearl River estuary."
"A comprehensive study of the marine currents of the Gulf of Uraba is presented for temporal scales ranging from intertidal to seasonal. The analyses made were based on three-dimensional (3D) numerical modeling and extensive current observations. The hydrodynamic model based on the Delft3D platform included the influence of different forcings such as tide, waves, atmosphere, river discharges, and density gradients. Because field data concerning these variables are scarce for the study area, measuring campaigns, in combination with global models and databases, were used to overcome this condition. The evaluation of the model was attained by the use of unprecedented field data obtained in different climatic seasons through a mobile gauge station. This station registered instantaneous vertical profiles of flow along 1200 km with approximately 50-m spacing. This type of measurement was preferred instead of those obtained from stationary stations, because the spatial gradients of the currents were much greater than their temporal variations. The good agreement of the 3D mathematical model in the reproduction of the observed instantaneous currents supported its use in defining the marine currents in the gulf. A combined analysis of the model results and the measured currents revealed a complex circulation pattern comprising simultaneously typical estuarine circulation, one- to three-layer flows, and even inverse circulation. This flow complexity would hardly have been determined through common measurement methodologies based on stationary gauge stations."
"Results from Storm-induced BEAch CHange (SBEACH) model calibration studies have provided new techniques and support for selection of model input parameters and interpretation of model output results. Beach and dune erosion analyses using the SBEACH erosion model in St. Johns County, Florida, demonstrated sensitivity of simulated erosion to changes of two model input parameters: sediment grain size and maximum slope prior to avalanching (MSPA). The MSPA parameter corresponds with the seaward slope of the dune or beach-berm erosion escarpment at the landward limit of the storm-induced erosion. Model calibration work demonstrated trends of these two model input parameters and of the sediment-transport rate coefficient K in relation to changes in beach slope. Evaluation of beach-slope values computed from county-wide topographic survey data in relation to the available mean sediment-grain-size data has shown clear correlation between these two parameters. This analysis provided a method for estimating mean sediment-grain-size values needed for SBEACH model input throughout St. Johns County. Results of SBEACH calibration work performed throughout St. Johns County demonstrated trends in the K and MSPA model input parameters relative to mean sediment-grain-size variations. Results of SBEACH model calibration studies in Panama City Beach, Florida; Brevard County, Florida; and on barrier islands within the Barataria Basin along the Louisiana coast demonstrated consistency with these identified trends."
"The detection of shoreline changes in coastal countries is critical for successful management and planning. Determining shoreline changes and investigating reasons behind uncontrolled changes ensure that the necessary precautions can be taken. This study focuses on determining temporal changes that have occurred on the shoreline of the Kizilirmak Delta, which is one of the most crucial wetlands protected by the Ramsar Convention in Turkey. Landsat-5 thematic mapper (TM) satellite images from 1987, 1998, 2002, 2007, and 2011 were used to determine temporal changes. The approach, which integrates band-ratioing and histogram-thresholding methods, was applied using the second, fourth, and fifth bands of the Landsat TM images. The shoreline change envelope (SCE), end point rate (EPR), and linear regression rate (LRR) methods were used to determine the shoreline changes. The SCE method detected a landward migration that occurred on the delta, where its maximum migration was 655.6 m between 1987 and 2011. During the same period, the maximum coastal change rate was estimated to be -27.4 m/y using the EPR method and -29.7 m/y using the LRR method. The maximum amount of erosion occurred near the river mouth. The results indicated that the dams built on the Kizilirmak River and close to the delta significantly affected these changes and that the spurs, which were built to prevent coastal erosion and provide partial protection, cannot fully prevent erosion."
"In meso-tidal lagoons, the coral reef barrier can be temporarily submerged at high tide and partially exposed at low tide, which causes highly specific lagoon dynamics. To understand those dynamics, three field-measurement campaigns were conducted in the Toliara Lagoon (Madagascar), where the tide and the waves increase that effect. The method combined measurements taken from fixed moorings and measurements from a small, moving, inflatable boat along the transects through the reef passages. A tidal analysis methodology adapted to this lagoon was used to reconstitute the currents through the passages and to determine the spatial and temporal current variability. Then, the lagoon water dynamics were studied. The tidal dynamics of the lagoon appear to depend significantly on flows through the passages, although they were also affected by water passing across the reef. Water entered the lagoon through the passages during the tidal flow and left it during the ebb. The tidal-prism flushing time (estimated using the tidal prism method) was 1 day during spring tide and 5 days during neap tide. At the same time, the average flow during a tidal cycle appears to be directly linked to the waves breaking over the reef. Indeed, the average cross-reef flow was inflowing and was mainly driven by the ocean swell. That inflow was balanced by an outflow through the passages. Hence, the average bulk flushing time was estimated at 13 days during the wet season and 4 days during the dry season."
"The Holocene/Pleistocene barrier along the coast of southern Brazil, separating the Patos Lagoon (the largest in South America) from the South Atlantic Ocean, contains a surficial unconfined aquifer that connects to both water bodies. This has been the site of previous studies on surface-water chemistry and on the subterranean estuary (SE) and submarine groundwater discharge (SGD) along the barrier beach. In this paper we present the results of observations from monitoring wells placed in three transects across this barrier and make a preliminary assessment of spatial variations in chemistry of aquifer water, based on analyses of samples collected over a period of several years, and its relation to that of adjacent surface waters. In addition to general groundwater chemistry (DO, pH, Eh, and conductivity), dissolved nutrients (inorganic N, phosphate, and silicate) and trace metal (Ba, Cd, Co, Cu, Fe, Mo, Mn, Ni, U, V, and Zn) concentrations were also determined. From the results we conclude that the Patos Lagoon Barrier (PLB) aquifer serves as a reactive reservoir/filter of inputs from terrestrial runoff to the ocean. Processes occurring in the aquifer and at its interfaces with the ocean and lagoon influence nutrient composition and trace metal concentrations of adjacent surface waters and alter the land-sea flux of some dissolved trace metals."
"Coastal lagoons receive significant inputs from river basins, leading to inner estuaries or fluvial lagoon subsystems subject to the bidirectional flow of energy, organic matter, nutrients, and sometimes toxic materials between river mouths and lagoons. Such exchanges are highly dynamic and enhance lagoon productivity. Terminos Lagoon (TL) is a large coastal lagoon in the southern Gulf of Mexico that has two deep permanent inlets connecting the lagoon to the Gulf and strong riverine input. We evaluated the influence of river discharge on seasonal and spatial patterns of water quality in six fluvial lagoon subsystems in TL. Six bimonthly samplings were carried out from February to December 2001. Temperature, salinity, dissolved oxygen, dissolved inorganic nutrients (nitrate, nitrite, ammonium, soluble reactive phosphorus, and soluble reactive silica), and chlorophyll a were measured. There were large differences between the western and eastern river mouths due to differences in river discharge and the nature of their watersheds (e.g., land use, size). Furthermore, the influence that the dominant depositional environment and local habitats (i.e. submerged aquatic vegetation) developing adjacent to these estuarine lagoon subsystems may exert over the nutrient concentrations of the water column is discussed. These differences were more evident during the rainy season when river discharge was highest. It is suggested that the input of N rather than P could have the greatest impact on TL in the future."
"Along with the numerous benefits of rapid reclamation and economic advancement in islands, the intensified conflict between island development and ecosystem sustainability should arouse concern worldwide. The islands in Zhejiang, China, have been an outstanding center of marine economic development but also among the areas most threatened by human activities in recent years. This study aimed to investigate the historical impacts of development and reclamation on the islands' land expansion and morphology change from the 1970s to 2013 and to identify the strongest signals of land transitions among the expanded areas. The results indicated that the islands dramatically expanded during 2000-13, with a threefold area increase compared to the first 30 years of the study period, and that the coastlines geometries became simpler with strong decreases in fractal dimension. More than 50% of the additional land was occupied by artificial structures that substantially altered the physical environment. These changes were mostly concentrated on the three island types: comprehensive, port and industry, and tourism. They are mainly the outcome of the spatial co-occurrence of port, logistics, and coastal industries or tourism establishments in response to government plans; moreover, the alteration of economic patterns presents as an aggravating force. Historically, the extensive islands' land expansion for coastal activities has brought about economic prosperity, but it has done so at the expense of environmental degradation, which highlighted the implications for guiding sustainable island development, particularly under the background of current economic booms in maritime China."
"The postnourishment beach evolution is evaluated on a sea-breeze-dominated microtidal beach in Yucatan (Mexico). The study area has experienced severe beach erosion due to both alongshore sediment-transport gradients during calm conditions and offshore sediment transport during extreme wave events. Therefore, a shoreline restoration program, including beach nourishment and the removal of groynes, was carried out in 2002. Bimonthly subaerial/intertidal beach profiles measured during 7 years (2002-09), in front of a seawall and at an adjacent beach (nonwalled), are employed to analyze the beach nourishment evolution. Empirical orthogonal function (EOF) analysis of the shoreline time series is performed using the data extracted from the 50 field surveys. The temporal evolution of the EOF analysis shows the following: (1) an abrupt increase in beach width due to nourishment at the study site at the beginning of 2003, (2) followed by a sustained increase (from 2004 to 2007) owing to the sediment advection from a massive beach fill performed up-drift of the study area, and (3) a decrease in beach width from 2007 until the end of the study period. Moreover, the mean profile-volume change is estimated separately for walled and nonwalled beach sections. The nonwalled profiles results are consistent with the temporal evolution described by the EOF analysis. On the other hand, walled beach profiles show a net volume loss from 2002 to 2007, remaining stable during the following 3 years Consistent with previous studies, seasonal variability of sand volume was found to be greater in front of the seawall with respect to the nonwalled section. Nevertheless, the erosional/despositional rates in the two sections show opposite trends during mean (sea-breeze) wave conditions, being more important in the subaerial beach profiles. The latter implies that awash-zone sediment transport represents an important contribution to the total sediment budget in the study area; hence, seawalls can significantly modify coastal dynamics in sea-breeze-dominated environments."
"Washouts have an important function in backshore zone drainage and remobilization of sediments for littoral transport. It is known that they can change beach morphology along its course, but their effects on the macrofauna community still represent a gap in knowledge of sandy beach ecology. Based on previous studies developed in larger systems, such as channels and estuaries, we aimed to assess how the macrofauna community responds to the presence of a permanent sandy beach washout. The study was carried out at an exposed sandy beach in southern Brazil, where six cross-cut transects 0, 3, 9, 27, 81, and 243 m in distance from the washout were defined. Biological and environmental samples were taken at nine levels along each transect. As expected, beach morphology and water table salinity were affected by the washout, resulting in changes in the macrofauna zonation pattern and community descriptors. The isopods Tholozodium rhombofrontalis and Excirolana armata were dominant at all levels close to the washout, where polychaetes, amphipods, and mollusks were almost absent. Macrofauna reached the typical zonation pattern for local, nearby beaches only at distant transects. A good correlation between biological and environmental variables was observed. These results indicate that washouts can modify the macrofauna community at a small spatial scale, and only species adapted to a high range of variation in salinity (euryhalines) with a high mobility can live in substantial numbers close to and within these freshwater streams."
"Coastal vulnerability assessment is important to help achieve the sustainable use of coastal resources and to incorporate coastal hazards into coastal planning and decision making for integrated management. This study applied the coastal vulnerability index (CVI) to delineate susceptibility of the South Sinai coastline to climate change. The following variables pertaining to inherent shoreline characteristics were used in the assessment of the CVI: coastal slope, coastal geomorphology, fauna/flora, and socioeconomic factors. GIS and remote sensing analysis were employed to extract intrinsic attributes of the coast in this study area. Results showed that about one half of the 635-km-long coastline is exposed to high and very high coastal vulnerability to climate change, and global warming could exacerbate biologic suffering in the region. The Gulf of Suez is likely to be more vulnerable than the Gulf of Aqaba. Most areas susceptible to climate change include gentle, unconsolidated, coral assemblages and inhabited coastal segments. Coastal zone managers should implement remediation plans for any anticipated ecosystem disruption episodes."
"The Blue Flag is a beach award aimed to preserve features of the beach environment. While it is assumed that the Blue Flag attracts tourism, this depends on factors such as the socio-demographic background of beachgoers, their perception of beach attributes, and their knowledge and perception of the Blue Flag. This research used structural equation modeling (SEM) to investigate relationships between perceived beach attributes (beach selection criteria, deterrent factors of the beach, and beach quality rating) and beachgoers' knowledge and perception of the Blue Flag award on three Blue Flag and three non-Blue Flag beaches in South Africa. A single statistically significant relationship emerged between beach quality rating and evaluation (both positive and negative views, which are not necessarily mutually exclusive) of the Blue Flag award by beachgoers. The data highlight the importance of generating bottom-up information to assist potential, occasional, and running Blue Flag managers in South Africa, particularly in regard to proper education and promotion of the Blue Flag award."
"Contaminated sediment tends to consolidate in response to the loading imposed by an overlying cap layer. The form of transient solute advection through sediments and caps is consequently changed. Therefore, the contaminant discharge into the overlying water is expected to increase and the effectiveness of the in situ capping system will be strongly affected. In this study, a one-dimensional sediment cap model coupling consolidation and advection dispersion equation was established. A simplified model was proposed through the sensitivity analysis, and then a parametric study was conducted. Numerical examples concluded that the absorption, degree of sediment saturation, cap thickness, and sediment depth significantly affect the contaminant discharge from the top of the cap. Therefore, these parameters should be considered carefully during cap design."
"This study numerically investigated tsunami-like solitary waves propagating over a row of vertical, slotted, cylindrical piles. Existing studies using depth-integrated models, such as shallow-water equations, could not adequately resolve the wave dynamics over water depth. An alternative three-dimensional, numerical model, based on OpenFOAM(R) software, was developed for this study. The Navier-Stokes equations for two-phase, incompressible flow, combined with methods of large eddy simulation (LES) for turbulence closure and volume of fluid (VOF) for tracking the free surface, were solved. Laboratory experiments were performed on the measurements of flow near the piles and the dynamic pressures on the pile surface. The model was then validated with the laboratory data as well as data in the literature, and good agreements were found for wave, flow, and dynamic pressure near the slotted piles. Finally, a set of numerical experiments was conducted to examine the evolutionary behaviors of wave run-up, vortex generation, and the vertical structure of dynamic pressure around the row of slotted piles and around a single pile. Total force between the row of slotted piles and a single pile was compared and discussed in the light of the Morison equation."
"Solidago sempervirens L. and Solidago sempervirens L. subsp. mexicana (L.) Semple are New World humid continental, temperate, subtropical, and tropical maritime taxa. Both taxa are long-lived perennials that occur in wet mineral sands and clay soils. Reproduction is primarily vegetative in stable sites. However, achene/seed production is prolific, and seed viability is high in either stable or disturbed sites. Also known as seaside goldenrod, both taxa occur in conditions ranging from freshwater to salinity conditions of 40 parts per thousand. Seeds and seedlings do not tolerate excessive burial, but high levels of sand deposition are associated with plant vigor in mature clones. Optimal growth for both taxa occurs in habitats with increasing distance from the water table."
"Appropriate coastal zone management and storm-damage risk reduction requires the assessment of vulnerability in natural and human environments. Confusion arises, however, as vulnerability is conceptualized in many different ways and is closely related to other concepts such as risk and resilience. This paper defines nomenclature, presents a conceptual definition of vulnerability, and lays out a proposed conceptual approach for identifying and defining meaningful metrics to ensure a complete assessment of coastal vulnerability. While the focus of this paper is developing metrics for assessing vulnerability to coastal storms, the approach is valid for a wide range of systems and hazards at multiple scales and can explicitly consider the impacts of climate change. The approach is demonstrated through application to a simply coupled human-environment system on the coast and explicitly considers natural and nature-based features."
"Sediment samples were collected from the deep portion of Kachemak Bay, Alaska, for chemical analysis, toxicity testing, and infaunal community assessment as part of a larger Cook Inlet project. The benthos samples were sieved through nested 1.0- and 0.5-mm screens to allow a comparison of the relative efficacy of the two techniques. The community was highly diverse at all sampled locations (Shannon-Weiner Index > 3). Abundance was dominated by a relatively small number of species. A significantly higher number of individuals and species were retained on the 0.5-mm screen. Sieving the benthic organisms with a 1.0-mm sieve introduced biases in the data relative to the 0.5-mm screen, including calculations such as diversity and other parameters such as feeding guild distributions and benthic indices. Using a 0.5-mm mesh sieve did increase sample analysis costs and resulted in a larger number of individual organisms that were not identified to species."
"Ecological experiments designed to examine the effects of macrofaunal biodiversity may require the defaunation of intertidal sediments; however, many current techniques result in physical disruption of the sediments. A method of field-based cryogenic defaunation, which has advantages over existing methodologies, was developed to provide macrofaunal defaunation of intertidal cohesive sediment with minimum physical disruption. A sediment core transport apparatus and polystyrene freezing chamber allow the use of liquid nitrogen for effective freezing of a whole core of sediment in the field. Freezing the whole core intact minimises physical disturbance to the sediment and retains the topography of the sediment surface and sediment grain distribution with minimal effect on sediment properties and the microphytobenthos. This method is effective at removing up to 97% of infaunal macrofauna abundance from the sediment. Hediste diversicolor were found to be the most resistant species, with a 71% reduction in species abundance. Sediments defaunated in this way can be replaced in situ or removed to the laboratory for experimentation. This method of cryogenic defaunation would also be suitable for the defaunation of other marine or terrestrial sediments."

"Portable open-path laser (OPL) instruments provide a way to measure real-time, in situ atmospheric methane (CH4) concentrations at a variety of spatial and temporal scales. Our results suggest that OPL instruments may be simple and effective tools for monitoring atmospheric CH4 dynamics near ground-level in Arctic landscapes. We used a CH4 detecting OPL instrument at seven different field sites in southwest Greenland during the summer of 2012 to monitor atmospheric CH4 concentrations in the presence of local CH4 sources and sinks. Measurements with the OPL were conducted for deployments between 0.4 and 40 h over path lengths between 10 and 300 m. These measurements were checked against periodic grab samples analyzed in the field lab using cavity-enhanced absorption spectroscopy. Mean concentrations of atmospheric CH4 measured with the OPL across all field sites ranged from 1.72 (+/- 0.12) to 1.88 (+/- 0.15) ppm by volume (ppmv). The median atmospheric CH4 concentration measured using cavity-enhanced absorption spectroscopy was 1.82 +/- 0.04 ppmv. Slightly elevated CH4 concentrations were measured downwind of one lake and in a subglacial cave. OPL measurements of atmospheric CH4 concentrations agreed with results from cavity-enhanced absorption spectroscopy (<3% difference). OPL technology may be a useful tool for extended CH4 monitoring studies in the Arctic and may help in our understanding of atmospheric CH4 concentrations at spatial and temporal scales not accessible to other forms of measurement."
"The depths of snow in the Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau simulated by 19 phase five of the Coupled Model Inter-Comparison Project (CMIP5) models are assessed in comparison with the observation ones from passive microwave satellite remote-sensing (PMSR) and 72 weather stations. The annual regional mean snow depths (ARMSDs) from 1851 to 2005 indicate decreases for most of the models but slight increases for CMCC-CM, FGOALS-g2, and CanESM2. The simulated ARMSD anomalies vary from -10 cm to 20 cm, and the amplitudes exhibit obvious decreases over the recent 50 years. In the period from 1986 to 2005, the spatial distributions of the annual mean snow depth (AMSD) simulated by MRI-CGCM3, CCSM4, CESM1-BGC, CESM1-CAM5, and CESM1-WACCM are quite similar to those from the PMSR observations. But the maximum and mean AMSD values simulated by all 19 models are much larger than those observed by PMSR. The inter-annual variation of snow, which occurs primarily in the Middle and East Tibetan Plateau, is simulated relatively well by inmcm4. From 1960 to 2005, the ARMSDs simulated by most of the models show decreases but are increasing according to actual observations. Only five models produce positive trends that agree with the observations. According to the selected indices, the CCSM4, MIROC5, MRI-CGCM3, and FGOALS-g2 models are selected as relatively good models for predicting the plateau snow, and the 21st century changes in the snow climate in the Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau are projected using these four models."
"Lidder tributary in the Upper Indus Basin (UIB) of the Himalayas, an important source of surface and ground water, is experiencing clear indications of climate change. In the basin, minimum, maximum, and average temperatures are showing a significant increasing trend in all the four seasons. Precipitation is showing insignificant decrease over time in the basin. However, the proportion of snow is decreasing and correspondingly, the proportion of rains is increasing. The temperature projections also show increasing trends for the end of this century. The time-series analysis of the Normalized Difference Snow Index (NDSI) shows a depletion of the snow-cover in the region. Furthermore, during the past 51 years, the glacier area in the basin has decreased from 46.09 km(2) in 1962 to 33.43 km(2) in 2013, a depletion of 27.47%. As a result of glacier recession in the basin, the streamflow fed predominantly by snowmelt and glacier melt, is showing a statistically significant decline since the mid-1990s. The declining streamflows have potential to adversely affect agriculture, energy production, tourism, and even domestic water supplies. The Snowmelt Runoff Model (SRM) was tested for estimating the runoff from this glaciated basin on an operational basis. The average simulated runoff 11.94 m(3) s(-1) at the outlet is in concordance with the average measured runoff 13.51 m(3) s(-1) showing R-2 of 0.82. The model could thus be used for snowmelt runoff estimation, on an operational basis, for judicious utilization of the depleting water resources in the region."
"Knowledge of Arctic snow and ice surface albedo is essential to understand local energy budget and snow/ice albedo feedback under global warming scenario. In situ measured albedo plays an essential role by providing ground truth reference for remote sensing monitoring of albedo at large scale. Such measurements with portable and fixed-location spectroradiometers were conducted in one 12-day (long-term) and several short-term (3-4 hours) ice stations over the Pacific Arctic sector during the summer 2010 Chinese National Arctic Research Expedition (CHINARE). Results show that the wavelength-integrated albedo across 350 to 2200 nm of bare ice was similar to 0.56 to 0.68 in the lower latitudes and marginal ice zone, while albedo of snow-covered ice reduced from 0.75-0.86 to 0.42-0.61 during the mid-August period of the 12-day ice station (86 degrees 48'N to 87 degrees 20'N). The albedo variation and evolution of melt ponds were examined with details during the 12-day ice station. It is found that albedo of melt pond reduced from 0.68 (melt pond snow, 9 August) and 0.66 (melt pond ice, 9 August) to 0.32 (melt pond water and ice, 17 August) in one week as a rainfall event occurred. Such rapid decreasing of snow and sea ice albedo and evident difference between the pack ice zone and marginal ice zone may contribute to the surface albedo feedback and rapidly shrinking summer sea ice extent in the Arctic Ocean."
"Little is known about recent rates of carbon storage in montane peatlands, particularly in the western United States. Here we report on recent rates of carbon accumulation (past 50 to 100 years) in montane groundwater-fed peatlands (fens) of Yosemite National Park in central California, U.S.A. Peat cores were collected at three sites ranging in elevation from 2070 to 2500 m. Core sections were analyzed for bulk density, % organic carbon, and Pb-210 activities for dating purposes. Organic carbon densities ranged from 0.026 to 0.065 g C cm(-3). Mean vertical accretion rates estimated using Pb-210 over the 50-year period from similar to 1960 to 2011 and the 100-year period from similar to 1910 to 2011 were 0.28 (standard deviation = +/- 0.09) and 0.18 (+/--0.04) cm yr(-1), respectively. Mean carbon accumulation rates over the 50- and 100-year periods were 95.4 (+/- 25.4) and 74.7 (+/- 17.2) g C m(-2) yr(-1), respectively. Such rates are similar to recent rates of carbon accumulation in rich fens in western Canada, but more studies are needed to definitively establish both the similarities and differences in peat formation between boreal and temperate montane fens."
"Alpine areas in Meganesia occur on maritime and continental mountains, and range from tropical to warm and cool temperate. At their current treelines, we measured soil temperatures, which were found to be within the bounds for treeline temperatures worldwide. We modeled areas above these alpine treelines using (1) a growing season mean synoptic temperature of 6.4 degrees C at treeline and (2) monthly temperature extremes. It was possible to adjust the threshold temperatures of the growing season model until predicted areas approximated observed alpine areas for New Guinea, the Australian mainland Snowy Mountains, and Tasmania, but meaningful predictions could not be made for the unknown alpine area of the Victorian Alps. The temperature extreme model was unsuitable for New Guinea and Tasmania but gave better predictive results for the Victorian Alps. We correctly predicted a strong relationship between alpine area and number of alpine vascular plant species and between regional area and number of terrestrial vertebrate species. However, there was no clear relationship between alpine area and alpine terrestrial vertebrate richness. Differences among the mountains were better explained by climatic extremes and insolation. If local explanations are required to model alpine vertebrate fauna, it is difficult to build robust global models and consequently make general predictions of climate change impacts."
"Previous research collectively demonstrates the importance of taking local moisture availability and biotic threshold responses into account when seeking to reveal the ecological manifestations of climate change within upper treeline ecotones. Yet dendroecological studies that explicitly address the role of slope aspect in this context are non-existent. In this paper, we examine whether slope aspect and related temperature-precipitation interactions mediate abrupt increases in tree establishment and pulses of upper treeline advance (>= 10 m) on contrasting north-and south-facing slopes during wet and dry periods of the 20th century. We used regime-shift analysis to quantify episodic changes in the rate of tree regeneration at each site (p < 0.05). We employed a climatic water deficit approach to define fine-scale moisture conditions to compare with dendroecological data from opposite aspects on eleven mountain peaks along a latitudinal gradient in the U.S. Rocky Mountains. Regime-shift analysis measured abrupt, yet asynchronous increases in tree establishment across contrasting slope aspects on 10 of 11 mountain peaks. Upper treeline advance was significantly greater (p < 0.05) during drought on north-facing slopes. On south-facing slopes, ecotonal dynamics varied more with respect to fluxes in the climatic water deficit; namely because of differences in local hydroclimate regimes. Collectively, these results underscore the importance of considering both slope aspect and temperature-moisture interactions when elucidating climate-vegetation interactions within upper treeline ecotones."
"Soil nutrient supply is likely to change in the Arctic due to altered process rates associated with climate change. Here, we compare the responses of herbaceous tundra and birch forest understory to fertilization, considering both above-and below-ground responses. We added nitrogen and phosphorus to plots in both vegetation types for three years near Abisko, northern Sweden, and measured the effect on above-and below-ground plant community properties and soil characteristics. Fertilization increased ground-layer shoot mass, the cover of grasses, and tended to enhance total root length below-ground, while it reduced the cover of low statured deciduous dwarf-shrubs. The only statistically significant interaction between vegetation type and fertilization was for grass cover, which increased twofold in forest understory but sixfold in tundra following fertilization. The lack of interactions for other variables suggests that the ground layers in these contrasting vegetation types have similar responses to fertilization. The nutrient-driven increase in grass cover and species-specific differences in productivity and root characters may alter ecosystem dynamics and C cycling in the long-term, but our study indicates that the response of birch forest understory and tundra vegetation may be consistent."
"Reactive nitrogen (Nr) from anthropogenic sources has been altering ecosystem function in lakes of the Rocky Mountains, other regions of western North America, and the Arctic over recent decades. The response of biota in shallow lakes to atmospheric deposition of Nr, however, has not been considered. Benthic algae are dominant in shallow, high-elevation lakes and are less sensitive to nutrient inputs than planktonic algae. Because the benthic substrate is typically more nutrient rich than the water column, shallow lakes are not expected to show evidence of anthropogenic Nr. In this study, we assessed sedimentary evidence for regional Nr deposition, sediment chronology, and the nature of algal community response in five shallow, high-elevation lakes in Grand Teton National Park (GRTE). Over 140 diatom taxa were identified from the sediments, with a relatively high species richness of taxa characteristic of oligotrophic conditions. The diatom assemblages were dominated by benthic taxa, especially motile taxa. The GRTE lakes demonstrate assemblage-wide shifts in diatoms, including the following: (1) synchronous and significant assemblage changes centered on ca. A. D. 1960; (2) pre-1960 assemblages differed significantly from post-1960 assemblages; (3) pre-1960 diatom assemblages fluctuated randomly, whereas post-1960 assemblages showed directional change; and (4) changes in delta N-15 signatures were correlated with diatom community composition. These results demonstrate recent changes in shallow high-elevation lakes that are most correlated with anthropogenic Nr. It is also possible, however, that the combined effect of Nr deposition and warming is accelerating species shifts in benthic diatoms. While uncertainties remain about the potential synergy of Nr deposition and warming, this study adds shallow lakes to the growing list of impacted high-elevation localities in western North America."
"Using continuous data obtained from 17 monitoring sites, the permafrost temperature profiles and the depths of zero annual amplitude (DZAA) on the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau are examined. Permafrost thermal trumpet curves are generally narrow and the DZAAs are generally shallow in warm permafrost regions, especially at sites where the permafrost temperature is close to 0 degrees C. The observed DZAAs in warm permafrost regions are indeed generally less than 7.0 m and for three sites less than 4.0 m. In low-temperature permafrost areas, the situation is reversed: the thermal trumpet curves are generally wide and the DZAAs are generally deep. Theoretical and numerical analyses clearly show there is a causal relationship between permafrost warming and the decrease of the DZAA. Latent heat effects are buffering the increase of permafrost temperature and result in narrow thermal trumpet curves and shallow DZAAs. Based on observations and numerical analyses, this research suggests that most of the permafrost on the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau is undergoing internal thaw and the latent heat effects have important implications on the permafrost thermal regime. The temperature-dependent adjustments in permafrost will promote both the downward and upward degradation of permafrost as a result of climate warming."
"Late season alpine snows are often colonized by psychrophilic snow algae that may provide a source of nutrients for microbes. Such late season snows are a harsh environment, but support a diverse and complex fungal community. We used culture independent methods (Illumina MiSeq) to test if the presence of snow algae influences fungal communities. We compared algae-colonized snows to adjacent (3 m distant) noncolonized snows in a paired experimental design. Our data indicate that several fungi are locally enriched in algae colonized snows. Although many such fungi were basidiomycetous yeasts, our analyses identified a large number of snow-borne members of phylum Chytridiomycota. While the ecology and function of these Chytridiomycetes remain unclear, we hypothesize that their enrichment in the algal patches suggests that they depend on algae for nutrition. We propose that these chytrids are important components in snow ecosystems, highlighting the underestimation of their diversity and importance. Taken together, our data strongly indicate that fungal communities are heterogeneous in snow even among adjacent samples. Further, fungal and algal communities may be influenced by similar environmental drivers resulting in their co-occurrence in snow."
"Periodic monitoring over 52 years have revealed temporal changes in the vegetation and floristic patterns associated with what has been acclaimed to be the world's oldest known experimental snow fence, which is located on an exposed high-alpine cushionfield on the Old Man Range in south-central New Zealand. The induced pattern of intermittent snow-lie has been increased by the fence from the normal similar to 140 days to more than 200 days (and up to 140 cm deep), estimated from subsurface soil temperatures, together with periodic observations and measurements of snow depth. Some but not all species associated with natural snowbanks on the range have established in areas of induced snow accumulation. The timing of species establishment was not obviously related to relevant features of the local snowbank species or their distribution on the range, but the abundance of various plant species and their functional traits across zones of snowmelt point to competition and plant productivity being associated with the deepest snow in the lee of the fence. In addition, three of the several measured physical and chemical soil factors (Mg, available PO43-, and C:N) have differentiated significantly in relation to the vegetation and snow-lie pattern at year 52, although these seem not to be relevant on the basis of the pattern of the same factors in two nearby natural snowbanks on the range."
"Alpine treelines are considered monitors of the effects of climate on forest growth and dynamics. Treelines are expected to react to current climate warming by showing upslope migrations. However, treeline dynamics are often characterized by lagged responses to rising temperatures, that is, treeline inertia. In addition, encroachment within the treeline ecotone seems to be a more widespread response to climate warming than treeline ascent. We investigate how the treeline responds to climate in a Pyrenean site with an intense Mountain pine (Pinus uncinata) regeneration but also abundant dead trees. We use dendrochronology to reconstruct treeline dynamics (growth, tree recruitment, and death) and to build an age structure of Pyrenean Mountain pine forests, and relate them to temperature reconstructions of the study area. We also describe the spatial structure and estimate the size reproductive threshold of pine recruits. The study treeline showed profuse pine recruitment in the 1980s. These recruits were spatially aggregated and reached the 50% probability of reproduction at 24 years old. Most Pyrenean Mountain pines were recruited in the first half of the 18th century, a warm period when growth was stable, while old treeline trees recruited not only in those decades but also in previous warm periods. Pine deaths concentrated in the cool transition between the mid 17th and the early 18th centuries and mainly from 1820 to 1860, when growth declined as a consequence of temperatures rapidly dropping at the end of the Little Ice Age. Only the amount of dead pines at the treeline was negatively related to temperatures, indicating that cool periods cause high adult mortality rates and trigger long-term treeline decline. But this decline was interrupted by intense regeneration and treeline encroachment, two features that characterize recent treeline dynamics in some mountains. This concurs with the view of a rapid response of alpine treelines to climate during the late 20th century."
"Northern Alaska has warmed over recent decades and satellite data indicate that vegetation productivity has increased. To document vegetation changes in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge, we monitored plant cover at 27 plots between 1984 and 2009. These are among the oldest permanently marked and continuously monitored vegetation plots in the Arctic. We quantified percent cover of all plant species by line-point intercept sampling and assessed change over time for seven plant growth forms. Cover of bryophytes and deciduous shrubs showed slight decreasing trends. Evergreen shrubs, horsetails, and depth of thawed soil above permafrost had no trends. For lichens, graminoids, and forbs, trends varied by plant community type. Overall, vegetation in the plots changed little over the study period, in contrast to results from other studies in northern Alaska. A few plots had dramatic changes, however, which we attributed to subsidence from melting ground ice or to floodplain dynamics. Our results demonstrate that vegetation change on the Arctic Refuge coastal plain over the past quarter century has been spatially heterogeneous and facilitated by disturbance. The findings highlight the need for greater work linking plot-level and regional remote sensing measurements of change."
"From May 2007 to September 2008, six automatic weather stations (AWS) were installed along the traditional mountaineering line on the north slope of Mount Qomolangma. The elevations of the stations ranged between 5207 and 6560 m above sea level (a.s.l.). Some sounding data were also measured at Base Camp (5207 m a.s.l.) in late April and early May of 2007 and 2008. The spatial arrangement of the stations and temporal duration of the measurements, as well as the sounding data, generated a data set enabling the analysis of the wind regime in this region. The wind directions and speeds show change at different elevations because of the complicated terrain, the glacier-moraine-rock transition underlying surface, and the synoptic-scale wind. The katabatic wind dominates at low-elevation areas in the Rongbuk Valley, and the depth and frequency of it are about 800 m and 59% during the observational period. The up-valley wind always erodes the katabatic wind, and causes the lowest directional constancy in summer. With the elevation ascending, the katabatic wind weakens due to the smaller fetch and temperature contrast, as well as the relatively open landscape of the valley and smaller glacier area. At site 3 (5792 m a.s.l.), the frequency of the katabatic wind is only 25%, whereas the frequency of the up-valley wind is 47%, and especially in winter, the up-valley wind (82%) predominates all day. Moreover, the synoptic-scale wind also plays an important role in the surface wind regime on the north slope of Mount Qomolangma. From November to March, the active westerly troughs always intrude into the bottom of the Rongbuk Valley and could maintain the strong katabatic wind, and the maximum wind speed reaches 43.1 m s(-1) at site 1 (5207 m a.s.l.). At high-elevation areas, the westerlies can penetrates more easily, and dominate the wind regime. The wind speed can reach as high as 57.1 m s(-1) at site 3 in winter."
"Between 1801 and 1810, the Colombian cartographer, astronomer and botanist Francisco Jose de Caldas (1768-1816) produced a series of maps showing phytogeographical regions of taxon distributions drawn in three-dimensions across landscapes in the Andean region of present-day Ecuador. However, until the late 1990s, his phytogeographical maps remained unpublished and his methods largely unknown. To create his maps, Caldas generated three-dimensional topographic profiles showing the elevation, maximum and minimum limits of distribution for single species and taxon regions delimited according to latitude, illustrating the geographical extent of each phytogeographical region. Here, we provide evidence to argue that Caldas' scientific work is important for understanding the development of plant geography in late 18th century Latin America."
"Aim This paper addresses two opposing theories put forward for the origins of the beetle fauna of the North Atlantic islands. The first is that the biota of the isolated oceanic islands of the Faroes, Iceland and Greenland immigrated across a Palaeogene-Neogene land bridge from Europe, and survived Pleistocene glaciations in ameliorated refugia. The second argues for a tabula rasa in which the biota of the islands was exterminated during glaciations and is Holocene in origin. The crux of these theories lies in the ability of the flora and fauna to survive in a range of environmental extremes. This paper sets out to assess the viability of the refugia hypothesis using the climatic tolerances of one aspect of the biota: the beetle fauna. Location The paper focuses on Iceland, the Faroe Islands and Greenland. Methods The known temperature requirements of the recorded beetle faunas of the North Atlantic islands were compared with published proxy climate reconstructions for successive climate periods since the severing of a North Atlantic land bridge. We used the MCR (mutual climatic range) method available in the open access BugsCEP database software. Results We show that most of the MCR faunas of the North Atlantic islands could not have survived insitu since the Palaeogene-Neogene, and are likely to have been exterminated by the Pleistocene glaciations. Main conclusions The discrepancy between the climatic tolerances of the North Atlantic beetle fauna and the estimated climatic regimes since the severing of a land bridge strongly support the tabula rasa theory and suggests that the North Atlantic coleopteran fauna is Holocene in origin."
"Aim This study aims to reconstruct the evolutionary history of the African rodent genus Malacomys and to identify factors driving diversification within this genus. Location African tropical lowland forest. Methods Analyses were based on sampling representatives from most of the known geographical range of the genus. We assessed genetic structure and historical biogeography using a combination of mitochondrial and nuclear markers. Morphological differences between lineages were analysed using a geometric morphometric approach. Results Three species of Malacomys are recognized within the genus. Two are endemic to West Africa, and one is endemic to Central Africa. Our analyses reveal a strong phylogeographical structure with 13 lineages, most of them allopatric or parapatric. A complex biogeographical history, including dispersal-vicariance events, explains the current genetic structure of Malacomys. Discrete divergence events within the genus are dated to the mid-Pliocene (3.7Ma, 95% range: 2.4-5.2Ma) and the Pleistocene (less than 1.9Ma, with most events less than 1Ma). Morphological variation is partly congruent with genetic structure and may indicate local adaptations. Main conclusions Climatic oscillations, which led to periodic fragmentation of the forest habitat, seem to be the major driver of diversification within this genus. Our results support the existence of multiple small, rather than a few large, forest refugia during glacial maxima. Rivers have played a significant role in shaping boundaries of several regional haplogroups, either by promoting diversification or by preventing secondary contact between previously isolated lineages."
"Aim In New Caledonia, relictual angiosperm lineages are over-represented. However, the mechanisms responsible for such a distribution remain unclear. Two key hypotheses are that: (1) the diversity reflects adaptation to ultramafic substrates that ecologically filtered plant colonists; and (2) the diversity stems from wet climatic conditions that have persisted in New Caledonia during the late Quaternary while Australia and some nearby islands experienced widespread extinction events. Here, we investigate which hypothesis better explains the disharmony of relict angiosperms in New Caledonia. Location New Caledonia (South West Pacific Ocean). Methods We built species distribution models from herbarium data to determine the environmental correlates for 60 relict angiosperm taxa. Environmental variables used to characterize habitats included vegetation, substrate, and climate variables. We then tested whether the variety of xylem conduit structures borne by New Caledonian relict angiosperms, which is expected to affect plant hydraulic capacity, was correlated with habitat preference. Finally, we analysed species prevalence on different substrates and projected habitat size and distribution to the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM). Results We found a clear habitat preference among relict angiosperms for rain forests located on non-ultramafic substrates, with the exception of taxa bearing true vessels with simple perforation plates, which harboured a wider habitat breadth. We also showed that these rain forest habitats experienced a range reduction and an eastward shift during the LGM, forming two refugial areas located on the warm and rainy east coast of Grande Terre. Main conclusions Prevalence of relict angiosperms in habitats characterized by low evaporative demand appears to be related to xylem hydraulic limitations. The disharmony of relict angiosperms in New Caledonia therefore arose from the persistence of rain forests in the island despite global fluctuations in climate during the Quaternary that affected floras in the region. Our study offers a new model to explain why certain angiosperm families are disharmonically represented in New Caledonia."
"Aim Where post-glacial colonization and founder events are numerous, peripheral populations tend to have reduced genetic diversity as compared to their centrally located counterparts. Such decrease in genetic variability can limit their potential to adapt to changes in their environment. At northern latitudes for instance, populations are often living in conditions close to their physiological limits. Thus, identifying the levels of genetic diversity in peripheral populations is key to estimating the potential for adaptation to ongoing environmental change. In this context, we investigated the distribution of genetic diversity at the northern edge of the wood frog's (Lithobates sylvaticus) range by reconstructing its post-glacial history in an area where phylogeographical data were lacking. Location James Bay area (north-central Canada). Methods DNA was extracted from 463 wood frog tissue samples from 17 localities. Seven microsatellite loci were used to quantify genetic diversity and evaluate genetic structure through estimates of the fixation index, isolation-by-distance analyses and Bayesian clustering algorithms (tess and structure). Phylogeographical relationships were investigated using single nucleotide polymorphisms in the ND2/tRNA(TRP) mitochondrial genes. Phylogenetic trees were built using the neighbour-joining and the maximum likelihood inference methods implemented in mega5. Results Our analyses identified a contact zone between two colonizing lineages originating from one glacial refugium. Populations in this contact zone present sympatrically distributed haplotypes from both lineages and higher genetic variation than the surrounding populations. Population structure analyses revealed the differentiation of three genetic clusters, each covering large areas around the coast of James Bay. Main conclusions Our study suggests that higher than expected genetic diversity and gene flow may be present in peripheral populations. Such adaptive potential is critical in areas of upcoming development and environmental changes. Thus, our study emphasizes the importance of understanding species post-glacial history for the prediction of future evolutionary trends and species distributions."
"Aims We investigated post-glacial recolonization of the North American Arctic by Arctic char (Salvelinus alpinus) and examined potential hybridization between different glacial lineages upon secondary contact. Location North American Arctic and adjacent areas. Methods We collected mtDNA sequence data from 1355 individuals from 110 sampling locations and data from nine microsatellite loci from 931 individuals from 37 locations. We assessed the phylogenetic relationships and geographical distribution of mtDNA haplotypes and conducted historical demographic analyses. We used a Bayesian clustering analysis method to detect potential hybridization between glacial lineages. Results Two highly divergent mtDNA lineages were identified in the Arctic region with distinct but overlapping geographic distributions: one in Beringia and the other over the entire Arctic Archipelago and coastal mainland east of Alaska. The microsatellite data also implied the existence of these two lineages. Evidence of hybridization was detected between the Arctic lineage and an Atlantic lineage in eastern North America. Main conclusions Our data suggested survival and recolonization from two northern glacial refugia: one in Beringia and another in a smaller refugium, perhaps in the Arctic Archipelago itself or a separate refugium within Beringia. Patterns of hybridization detected supported the presence of a secondary contact zone between glacial lineages in the eastern Canadian Arctic."
"Aim The drivers of phylogenetic beta diversity include both local processes (e.g. environmental filtering) and regional processes (e.g. dispersal limitation). The role of environmental filtering can be investigated more directly by analysing community-environment associations, but dispersal limitation is one of the most challenging processes to examine. We investigated the role of traits related to dispersal - flight capacity, body size and voltinism - as drivers ofphylogenetic distance decay relationships in Neotropical stream insect communities. Location Headwater streams spread over 600km in south-eastern Brazil. Methods We compiled a data set of aquatic insect communities inhabiting streams across the State of SAo Paulo (Brazil). Then, we investigated environmental and spatial signals on phylobetadiversity patterns of aquatic insects using Mantel tests, multiple regressions on distance matrices and variation partitioning. We employed null models to investigate whether phylogenetic distance decay differed from pure compositional distance decay. We deconstructed the data set based on dispersal-related traits; we then ran distance decay analyses for these subsets separately. Results Geographical distance, rather than environmental distance, better explained the patterns of phylobetadiversity. We found that the phylogenetic decay relationship differed from the relationship expected for the null models only for univoltine, large-bodied genera with a high-flight capacity. Main conclusions Dispersal limitation, rather than species sorting, was the main driver for phylogenetic beta diversity in the metacommunity that we studied. We suggest that life-history strategies and mainly voltinism drive the distance decay of similarity in the insect communities examined. We additionally discuss the role of dispersal events over time to explain differences in distance decay patterns among tropical and other regions."
"Aims The aim was to identify the main drivers of aquatic macroinvertebrate species richness in spring-fen habitats (i.e. groundwater seepage wetlands) because these habitats are among the most threatened temperate biodiversity hotspots. Location Isolated spring fens in the western Carpathian Mountains. Methods Assemblages of Tricladida, Clitellata, Mollusca, Ephemeroptera, Plecoptera, Trichoptera and Diptera were sampled at 48 fens distributed evenly along a gradient of water mineral richness and grouped according to habitat specialization and dispersal mode. Several physicochemical parameters that have been reported to be the main drivers of species distribution were recorded for each site, along with radiocarbon measurements of the absolute age of the sites. The numbers of species in the taxonomic groups analysed were modelled as a function of the predictors via multiple linear regressions. Results We achieved a notably higher sampling efficiency than had been used in previous spring aquatic macroinvertebrate studies. In total, we collected and identified 255 species within 331 taxa from >235,000 individuals. The number of species in all taxonomic groups increased with water discharge but the highest predictive power was obtained with water redox potential, which explained as much as 55.7% of the specialist species richness variance. We found contrasting and systematic differences in the importance of predictors related mainly to the level of species habitat specialization. Species richness of spring-fen specialists was strongly determined by the main environmental gradient of change in groundwater chemistry, while generalists primarily reflected habitat stability linked to higher water discharge, habitat size and absolute age. Main conclusion Isolated island-like spring fens can harbour unusually species-rich assemblages of aquatic macroinvertebrates, the species richness of which is shaped by contrasting mechanisms dependent mainly on habitat specialization and also partly on dispersal mode. The richness of habitat specialist species seen at calcareous fens indicates their conservation priority."
"Aim Why some groups of species radiate, when others appear not to have done so, remains a fundamental question in evolutionary biology. Here, we investigate why island endemism, a common surrogate of speciation rate, reaches its lowest levels among land plants in bryophytes. Using molecular phylogeographical analyses in the moss genus Rhynchostegiella, we contrast the hypotheses (1) that the small size of oceanic islands and moderate genetic isolation in island populations with high dispersal capacities promote lower anagenetic diversification rates than in continental populations, and (2) that island and continental speciation rates do not differ, but island endemics quickly colonize continents. Location Macaronesia, Europe and Africa. Methods A time-calibrated multilocus species tree for 80 populations, representing the nine species of Rhynchostegiella across their entire distribution range, was constructed using beast. Based on this dated tree, ancestral ranges were estimated in BioGeoBears and speciation rates using bamm. Results Although island-endemic Rhynchostegiella species evolved anagenetically, speciation rates did not significantly differ between island and continental lineages. Seven episodes of colonization from islands to continental regions were inferred from ancestral-area estimations, which identified the Canary Islands as the ancestral distribution area of the genus, lending support to our second hypothesis. Main conclusions Our findings reinforce the view of north-eastern Atlantic archipelagos as departure gates' for the colonization of western Europe during the late Pleistocene. They further show that, over longer evolutionary time-scales, the colonization of continents from island ancestors can lead to speciation and contribute to extant patterns of continental diversity."
"Aim This study aimed to clarify species boundaries as well as phylogenetic relationships among species of the Primulina eburnea complex, a rapidly diversifying group of edaphic specialists confined to karst habitat islands in southern China. We investigated patterns of genetic isolation and diversification in this complex. Location Limestone karsts in southern China. Methods We analysed data from three chloroplast DNA (cpDNA) regions and eight nuclear microsatellite loci, representing five closely related species in the P. eburnea complex sampled from 62 populations across its entire distributional range. We conducted a Bayesian phylogenetic analysis, constructed maximum parsimony haplotype networks and assessed population genetic diversity, population differentiation and geographical structure within and between species. Results Of the 60 identified haplotypes, eight were shared between populations and only one was shared between species. Both cpDNA and the nuclear markers revealed a high level of population genetic differentiation and a strong phylogeographical structure. Four main genetic clusters were identified according to their geographical proximity, although geographical structuring differed slightly between the cpDNA and the nuclear loci. The pattern of genetic structure of both the cpDNA and microsatellite genomes can be explained by patterns of isolation by distance (IBD), across both the distribution of the complex and the populations of individual species. Main conclusions This is the first study to investigate geographical isolation and speciation in a clade associated with karst habitat islands in southern China. Geographically structured population differentiation of the P. eburnea complex suggests that divergence is mainly driven by genetic drift, with little evidence of gene flow. Allopatric speciation is the main mode of diversification in the group. These results highlight the importance of geographical isolation in promoting population differentiation in karst habitat islands."
"AimWe tested the hypothesis of character release in body size among allopatric populations of the carabid beetle Carabus japonicus by analysing geographical variation in body size in relation to habitat temperature and sympatry/allopatry with the larger congeneric species Carabus dehaanii. LocationThe main and satellite islands of Kyushu in the south-western part of the Japanese archipelago. MethodsWe studied geographical variation in the body length and genital size of C. japonicus populations at different sites to examine the effects of both habitat temperature and sympatry/allopatry with C. dehaanii. To determine whether the conditions for character release were fulfilled, we then estimated the heritable differences in body size by common garden rearing, and estimated the phylogenetic relationships among populations by molecular phylogenetic analysis. ResultsWhile body size was positively correlated with annual mean temperature, it was consistently small in sympatry but larger in some allopatric populations in warmer regions. The body size differences among populations were heritable. Allopatric C. japonicus populations on satellite islands were derived from the sympatric mainland populations. In a few sympatric areas, mitochondrial haplotypes were shared between the species because of introgressive hybridization, suggesting the occurrence of reproductive interference between the species. We also found that genital size was not affected by sympatry/allopatry, but was positively correlated with body size. Main conclusionsWe demonstrated that the increased body size of allopatric C. japonicus has evolved through a character release process. However, not all allopatric populations had enlarged body size, thus suggesting that some additional environmental factors are also involved. Geographical differentiation in body size and associated genital dimensions may result in prezygotic reproductive isolation among populations and promote allopatric differentiation leading to speciation."
"AimPelophylax frogs in East Asia provide an opportunity to explore the impact of glacial cycling on demographic and genetic dynamics, because it has been suggested that they experienced distribution shifts and subsequent mtDNA introgression from Pelophylax plancyi to Pelophylax nigromaculatus in association with climatic oscillations. However, their evolutionary history, including the pattern of introgression, is incompletely understood. We used phylogenetic analyses based on multiple markers to address their evolutionary history, and palaeodistribution modelling to test whether the predicted distribution can explain the pattern of introgression suggested by molecular phylogenetics. LocationEast Asia, including far-eastern Russia, mainland China, the Japanese archipelago, the Korean Peninsula and Taiwan. MethodsNinety-nine samples of the Pelophylax nigromaculatus species complex were collected from 75 localities throughout the distributional range of each species. Phylogenetic analyses were performed with the mitochondrial cytochrome b (cytb) gene and six nuclear genes using two European Pelophylax frogs as outgroups. Additionally, palaeodistributions of P.nigromaculatus and P.plancyi were predicted using bioclimatic variables. ResultsDifferences were observed between the mitochondrial and nuclear DNA trees in the phylogenetic position of P.plancyi. Similar phylogenetic discordance was also observed within P.nigromaculatus. Distribution modelling suggested that a considerable distributional shift of P.nigromaculatus occurred in association with glacial cycling and that the distributional range of P.plancyi was relatively narrow during glacial periods. Main conclusionsThe analyses detected five historical mtDNA introgression events and determined their directions, none of which had been deduced in previous studies. In association with glacial cycling, the distributional ranges of P.nigromaculatus and P.plancyi appear to have shifted repeatedly, resulting in multiple complex introgressions. By combining phylogenetic analyses with palaeodistribution modelling, our results supported the hypothesis that the history of mtDNA introgression among Pelophylax frogs was shaped by glacial cycling."
"AimWe take advantage of next generation sequencing-based technology to assess how landscape-level dynamics, biogeographical history and functional factors shape the distribution of genetic diversity in rain forest trees. To achieve this, we explore chloroplast genomic diversity and divergence patterns across multiple, co-distributed species from three major centres of rain forest diversity. LocationSubtropical rain forests in south-eastern Australia: Nightcap-Border Ranges, Dorrigo and Washpool. MethodsWe assembled chloroplast genomic data from whole-genome shotgun libraries for 71 species collected across three major centres of rain forest diversity. Chloroplast single nucleotide polymorphisms were used to measure genetic variation within and between multiple populations, species and locations, and we used this information to identify patterns related to landscape-level processes, biogeographical origins and functional characteristics. ResultsWe identified Nightcap-Border Ranges and Dorrigo as containing multiple refugia and Washpool as primarily a recolonized area. We found that rapidly expanding lineages of Indo-Malesian origin exhibit significantly lower levels of genetic diversity than Gondwanan lineages with longer local histories. Functional traits related to persistence and dispersal were the most important in regulating the distribution of genetic diversity. Main conclusionsThe distribution and assembly of species reflect interactions and competition between different floristic elements at different stages of continental occupation. Additionally, given the multiple evolutionary origins and histories of the Australian rain forest flora, it is important to avoid treating rain forest communities as single management units."
"AimPhysiological traits that approximate the fundamental climatic niche - the climatic conditions where a species can survive - are the outcome of adaptation to the environment under historical and current environmental constraints. If a large amount of the variation in physiological traits among species can be explained by their phylogeny rather than by contemporary environmental conditions, this would indicate phylogenetic conservatism in physiological traits, i.e. the tendency of species to retain their ancestral physiology over time. Here, we evaluate the relative contributions of phylogeny and environment to explain the variation in physiological traits of birds and mammals at the global level, as well as separately for tropical versus temperate species. LocationGlobal. MethodsWe compiled a large data set from the literature, on the thermal traits and basal metabolic rates of 552 endotherms (255 bird and 297 mammal species) as measured in physiological experiments, along with phylogenetic, geographical and climatic data. Our analyses, which were performed separately for birds and mammals, partitioned the variation in comparative physiological data into the relative contributions of phylogenetic and environmental distance matrices. ResultsOverall, the current environment explained a larger amount of variation in thermal traits among species than the phylogeny. However, we found that phylogeny was much more important than current environment for explaining the variation in physiological traits in the tropics, whereas environment was more important than phylogeny in temperate species. Main conclusionsWhile evidence for phylogenetic conservatism in physiological traits at the global level was weak, results for tropical species suggest phylogenetic conservatism in their physiological traits. These results indicate a stronger tendency in tropical species to retain their ancestral thermal traits, which might in turn imply a lower physiological adaptability of tropical species to ongoing and future climate change."
"AimTo determine whether a contemporary population of the moose (Alces alces), a large northern ungulate, retains genetic signatures of post-glacial recolonization and/or the effects of anthropogenic factors. We focused on investigating spatial genetic structure and the distribution of genetic diversity of this species to clarify its still obscure history. LocationEastern Fennoscandia, Northern Europe. MethodsIn total, 574 Finnish and Russian Karelian moose were genotyped at 16 microsatellite loci, and the mitochondrial control region was sequenced from 224 individuals. Spatially explicit Bayesian clustering, multivariate and spatial autocorrelation methods were applied alongside traditional F-statistics to study the effects of landscape on genetic structure. The demographic history of our study populations was explored with coalescent analysis and Bayesian skyline plots. ResultsA major mitochondrial divergence of moose was discovered between northern parts of Finland and the rest of the studied area. Landscape genetic analyses on the microsatellite data identified three genetic clusters connected by clines, with coalescent analysis indicating the division to be of ancient origin. Additionally, recent population bottlenecks were detected using Bayesian skyline plots. Main conclusionsOur results indicate a post-glacial secondary contact between two distinct moose mitochondrial lineages that diverged during the Pleistocene, whereas admixture of three diverged genetic subpopulations was detected using microsatellites. The emergence of these subpopulations was estimated to have occurred after the post-glacial recolonization of Fennoscandia. The observed genetic bottlenecks coincide with recorded historical population declines in the 18th century. We conclude that the contemporary genetic composition of the moose population in eastern Fennoscandia has been affected by both ancient and recent factors."
"AimThe goal of the study was to quantify changes in the extent of mangroves since the mid-twentieth century and to test the hypothesis that these changes are driven by ocean waves. LocationThe pristine 300-km-long coast of French Guiana, South America. MethodsWe produced time series of mangrove maps using archival remote sensing images. We retrieved significant wave heights (H-S), mean wave periods (T-M) and mean wave directions ((M)) from the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts reanalysis products. We used complex empirical orthogonal function (CEOF) decomposition to extract the main mode of mangrove surface area (M-S) variability and singular value decomposition (SVD) to test the relationships between M-S and H-S,T-M and (M). ResultsThe leading mode of variability extracted from the CEOF decomposition of M-S captured approximately 78% of the total auto-covariance and revealed multi-decadal fluctuations in M-S that were on the order of 10,000ha. The SVD results indicated that the multi-decadal fluctuation in M-S cross-covaried with H-S,T-M and (M) over the North Atlantic sector, particularly in the region immediately off the French Guiana coast that is remotely forced by the North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO) during the winter season. Main conclusionsWe provide evidence based on linear statistics that variations in the extent of mangroves are driven by large-scale, low-frequency changes in North Atlantic waves that are related to the NAO. Such a relationship is hypothesized to operate through wave pounding, which alters the mud substrates on which mangroves thrive and which varies with the phase of the NAO. In addition to long-term trends due to anthropogenic climate change, our results stress the importance of studying low-frequency modes of climate variability to understand changes in the extent of mangroves."
"AimForest responses to global-change drivers such as rising atmospheric CO2 concentrations (C-a), warming temperatures and increased aridification will depend on tree species and site characteristics. We aim to determine if rising C-a enhances growth of coexisting pine species along broad ecological gradients in a drought-prone area. LocationIberian Range, Spain. MethodsWe sampled 557 trees of five pine species encompassing a wide climatic gradient and measured their radial growth. We used nonlinear flexible statistics (generalized additive mixed models) to characterize growth trends and relate them to C-a, temperature and water balance. ResultsThe sites most responsive to the growing-season water balance were dominated by Pinus pinaster and Pinus nigra at low elevations, whereas those most responsive to temperatures were high-elevation Pinus sylvestris and Pinus uncinata stands. From 1950 onwards, most sites and species showed decreasing radial growth trends. Growth trends were coherent with a CO2-related fertilization effect only in one P.sylvestris site. Main conclusionsWe found little evidence of growth stimulation of Iberian pine forests due to rising C-a. The results indicated that any positive effect of a C-a-induced growth increase was unlikely to reverse or cancel out the drought-driven trends of reduced growth in most Mediterranean pine forests. Further assessments of CO2-fertilization effects on forest growth should be carried out in sites where climatic stressors such as drought do not override the effects of rising C-a on forest growth."
"AimPrescribed fire is a common land management for reducing risks from unplanned fires. However, the universality of such effectiveness remains uncertain due to biogeographical variation in fuel types, climatic influences and fire regimes. Here, we explore biogeographical patterns in the effectiveness of prescribed fire by calculating leverage (the reduction in unplanned area burnt resulting from recent previous area burnt) across south-eastern Australia over a 25year period. LocationThe 30 bioregions of south-eastern Australia. MethodsWe quantified leverage in each bioregion from fire records from 1975-2009, controlling for variation in annual weather. We also identified potential drivers of variation in leverage by relating the bioregional leverage values to measures of fuel type and growth, climate, and weather extremes. ResultsLeverage was inferred in four bioregions while in the other 26 bioregions no leverage was detected or prescribed fire had the opposite effect (fire-follows-fire). Leverage occurred in the forested eastern section of the study area, where rainfall, fuel load and fire activity is high and fire weather is mild. In all bioregions, weather was a stronger predictor than past-fire extent of area burnt in a particular year. Main conclusionsOur analysis of leverage shows that the effectiveness of prescribed fire varies regionally in predictable ways, which means that fuel management strategies applied in one region are not necessarily applicable in another. In most bioregions prescribed burning is likely to have very little effect on subsequent extent of unplanned fire, and even in regions where leverage occurs, large areas of treatment are required to substantially reduce the area burned by unplanned fire."
"Recent reviews of the meaning of the word chorotype' in biogeography have led to contrasting definitions and a confusion of concepts. This is because chorotype' has been used by different authors to express two different concepts: (1) groups of species with overlapping ranges (overall distributions) and (2) groups of species with a similar distribution within a certain area. To avoid confusion, I suggest the term global chorotype' be used to indicate a group into which species with similar ranges can be classified; and regional chorotype' be used for a group of species with similar distributions within a certain region. Although the global chorotype represents the world-wide spatial responses of species to historical and environmental pressures, and does not vary with the area under consideration, a particular species might be classified into different regional chorotypes in different study areas."
"Aim Nest microclimate is a critical determinant of the survival and development of embryonic and juvenile birds. While abiotic variables such as temperature, precipitation and elevation will influence the conditions experienced by offspring within the nest, parent birds may also exercise some control through nest design and the selection of construction material. The aim of this study is to determine whether avian nest construction and the composition of nest construction material is influenced by geographical variation in climate. In addition, this study aims to address whether the correlation between nest construction and elevation highlighted by other studies is independent of the association between elevation and climate, or if other unmeasured variables are at play. Location Australia Methods We measured the structural and thermal properties of 201 cup-shaped nests, from 36 Australian passerine species, and related these to temperature, precipitation and elevation. Results The rate of heat loss from avian nests is correlated with temperature, precipitation and elevation. Birds that construct nests in cool climates use well-insulating materials irrespective of precipitation, while birds in warm climates use poorly insulating materials when exposed to high rainfall but not when exposed to low rainfall. Main conclusions Local climate influences the construction of nests, through modification of the materials used, and therefore the rate of heat loss from the nest as a whole. In many climates, birds use well-insulating materials; however, birds breeding in warm and wet climates construct their nests with materials that have a higher thermal conductivity. Such nests are possibly less absorptive and able to dry out faster following a rain event, to restore the insulating function of the nest. These findings highlight the importance of studies over large geographical scales for understanding nest construction by birds."
"Aim To investigate the association between hummingbird-plant network structure and species richness, phylogenetic signal on species' interaction pattern, insularity and historical and current climate. Location Fifty-four communities along a c. 10,000 km latitudinal gradient across the Americas (39 degrees N-32 degrees S), ranging from sea level to c. 3700 m a.s.l., located on the mainland and on islands and covering a wide range of climate regimes. Methods We measured the level of specialization and modularity in mutualistic plant-hummingbird interaction networks. Using an ordinary least squares multimodel approach, we examined the influence of species richness, phylogenetic signal, insularity and current and historical climate conditions on network structure (null-model-corrected specialization and modularity). Results Phylogenetically related species, especially plants, showed a tendency to interact with a similar array of mutualistic partners. The spatial variation in network structure exhibited a constant association with species phylogeny (R-2 = 0.18-0.19); however, network structure showed the strongest association with species richness and environmental factors (R-2 = 0.20-0.44 and R-2 = 0.32-0.45, respectively). Specifically, higher levels of specialization and modularity were associated with species-rich communities and communities in which closely related hummingbirds visited distinct sets of flowering species. On the mainland, specialization was also associated with warmer temperatures and greater historical temperature stability. Main conclusions Our results confirm the results of previous macroecological studies of interaction networks which have highlighted the importance of species richness and the environment in determining network structure. Additionally, for the first time, we report an association between network structure and species phylogenetic signal at a macroecological scale, indicating that high specialization and modularity are associated with high interspecific competition among closely related hummingbirds, subdividing the floral niche. This suggests a tighter co-evolutionary association between hummingbirds and their plants than in previously studied plant-bird mutualistic systems."
"Aim Deterministic niche theory predicts that increasing environmental heterogeneity increases species richness. In contrast, a recent stochastic model suggests that heterogeneity has a unimodal effect on species richness since high levels of heterogeneity reduce the effective area available per species, thereby increasing the likelihood of stochastic extinction (the ""area-heterogeneity trade-off'). We tested these contrasting predictions using data on bird distributions in North America. Location North America. Methods The effect of heterogeneity on species richness was tested using simultaneous autoregressive regression models based on two measures of heterogeneity (elevational range and land-cover richness) each quantified at two scales (400m, 5km), three measures of species richness (observed, corrected for incomplete detection, and corrected for regional richness) and three variable selection methods [forced entry, Akaike information criterion (AIC)-based and a null-model approach]. Covariates included precipitation, temperature, elevation and latitude. For all variables, both linear and quadratic terms were included in the analyses. Results Overall, heterogeneity had a weak effect on species richness and the contribution of the quadratic term of heterogeneity to the explained variance was very small (< 1%). Nevertheless, in all 36 models, the coefficients of both the linear and quadratic terms of heterogeneity were statistically significant and the estimated inflection point was within the range of the data, as predicted by the area-heterogeneity trade-off. Moreover, in 30 out of the 36 models, support for a unimodal effect of heterogeneity on species richness based on information theoretic criteria was strong (AIC>10), and in 22 of those 30 models the null hypothesis of a monotonically positive relationship could be rejected at the 0.05% significance level. Main conclusions Patterns of bird richness in North America were predominantly consistent with the predictions of the area-heterogeneity trade-off. Future attempts to understand the mechanisms affecting species diversity should pay more attention to the potential consequences of this fundamental trade-off."
"Aim Biodiversity patterns and the mechanisms driving these patterns are inherently scale dependent. Studies investigating biodiversity scaling have focused mostly on evaluating community turnover without taking into consideration its underlying processes of local extinction (hereafter, extinction) and colonization. Our goal was to evaluate the spatial scaling of change in avian assemblages through time and identify environmental drivers of community-wide dynamics across a range of spatial scales, with a focus on extinction and colonization. Location New York State. Methods We analysed community dissimilarity, temporal turnover, extinction and colonization as measures of temporal change in avian communities at five spatial resolutions (5x5, 10x10, 20x20, 40x40 and 80kmx80km). We evaluated the relationships between community change and change in climatic conditions, landscape fragmentation and elevation at each spatial grain using Bayesian spatially varying intercept models. Results We found that the decline in colonization with increasing spatial scale was less steep than the decline in community dissimilarity, temporal turnover or extinction. We also found that the importance of environmental drivers to community change was dependent on both scale and metric, though we did not find optimal spatial scales at which either landscape or climatic processes consistently drove patterns of community change. Landscape characteristics were the most important correlate of extinction at all spatial scales, while colonization was not predicted well by any of the environmental factors. Main conclusions The slower decline in colonization across spatial grains is probably a consequence of the high mobility and dispersal abilities of birds. We further conclude that the two processes underlying community change - extinction and colonization - are driven by different factors. Landscape characteristics strongly affect the rates of extinctions in avian communities. On the contrary, patterns of colonization are likely to be a result of intrinsic characteristics of birds - specifically, high dispersal ability - that allow them to colonize new sites, regardless of the environmental context."
"Aim Climate and land use can have important effects on the local abundances of species, but few studies have investigated the relative impacts of these factors. Here, we quantify the relative importance of climate, land use and surrounding population size in determining the abundances of birds across a continent. Location Europe. Methods We used species abundance models to identify the relative importance of different environmental predictors for estimating the local abundances of 342 species of European breeding birds. Models controlling for phylogeny were used to relate species life history and ecological traits to the climate:land use importance ratio. The mean of this ratio, across all species occurring in a given area, was mapped to explore spatial variation in the major drivers of abundance. Results At the scale examined, climate is generally more important than land use in determining species abundances. However, the abundance of species in neighbouring areas is also a major correlate. Among climate variables, temperature is of greater importance than moisture availability in determining abundances. The relative importance of these variables varies with latitude, with temperature being most important in the north, and moisture availability in the south. Differences in the importance of specific drivers are related to species ecological traits: climate is more important for determining the abundance of species that have larger global ranges or a smaller body mass. Main conclusions Abundances of species occurring in northern Europe, an area predicted to experience climatic changes of high magnitude, are most sensitive to climate, particularly temperature. Given the greater confidence in future projections of temperature than precipitation, this increases confidence in projections of the impacts of climate change on species in the north, whilst attempts to predict future populations in central and southern Europe may be dependent on less predictable changes in land use and precipitation."
"Aim Recent research suggests that the latitudinal diversity gradient (LDG) in birds is unlikely to result from faster diversification in the tropics. This puts the focus on other mechanisms, such as dispersal, as the primary drivers for the LDG. We aim to distinguish two prominent models, tropical conservatism (TCH) and out of the tropics (OTM), which make distinct predictions about dispersal across latitudes and the phylogenetic clustering of assemblages in temperate regions. Location Global. Methods We used geographic and phylogenetic data for more than9000 bird species to reconstruct the ancestral latitudinal zone for each node in each of 100 bird phylogenetic estimates. We used methods that consider discrete latitudinal zones, as well as those that consider latitudinal position as a continuous variable. We then estimated the frequency of ancestor-descendant dispersal within and across latitudinal zones. We also quantified phylogenetic clustering in latitudinal zones separately for bird assemblages within the Old World and the New World. Results Latitudinal distributions are relatively conserved: 60-96% of nodes had the same inferred latitude as their immediate ancestral node. We find that dispersal events out of the tropics were less frequent (4-5%) than dispersal events into the tropics (15-21%), the opposite of what would be expected under the OTM. Nodes with inferred temperate distributions are generally younger than the Eocene-Oligocene Climate Transition, as expected under the TCH. Phylogenetic clustering shows no regular patterns of association with latitude, and is likely to be largely driven by radiations within a few large forested biomes. Main conclusions Our results provide support for the expectations of the TCH, but are less consistent with those of the OTM. Both the deeper origins of tropical clades and the comparatively recent but infrequent dispersal events into temperate regions appear to play a role in generating the strong disparity in tropical and temperate species richness in birds."
"Aim It has been widely assumed that large seeds generally require large animals to ingest and disperse them. However, this relationship has only been quantified in single animal groups (e.g. birds) and in a few communities. Our goal was to provide the first broad-scale study of the relationship between animal body mass and ingested seed size. Location Global. Methods We compiled a dataset of 13,135 unique animalxseed interactions, animal body masses and seed sizes in these interactions, across all vertebrate groups (fish, amphibians, reptiles, birds and mammals). Results Contrary to expectations, ingested seed size was negatively related to animal body mass. This negative relationship was largely driven by large ungulates ingesting small and dry seeds, and analyses excluding either ungulates or seeds with non-fleshy fruit types showed a positive relationship between animal body mass and ingested seed size. Large animals ingested both seeds with a larger maximum size (the 95th quantile had a positive slope) and a smaller minimum size (the 5th quantile had a negative slope). Larger animals ingest larger seeds from fleshy fruits but smaller seeds from non-fleshy fruits. A significant positive relationship was found between animal size and the number of seed species ingested. Main conclusions Our data show that one of the assumptions that has underpinned the study of animal-seed interactions does not hold true across the full range of animal taxa and fruit types. These findings shed new light on theories about which types of plant species might be at risk if large animals go extinct, and cast doubt on the generality of a few theories (e.g. optimal diet theory, fruit-size hypothesis) about the relationship between frugivores and seeds."
"Aim Intrinsic qualities that might affect extinction risk are not well understood for lizards (suborder Lacertilia), a highly diverse and globally distributed group of reptiles (order Squamata). We use the Quaternary fossil record of Caribbean lizards to explore a commonly studied trait, body size, and its relationship to extinction. Location The Caribbean. Methods We compiled a body size database for over 300 species. We assessed whether the present-day body size distribution of lizards differed from the body size distribution of the fossil record. We also compared body sizes of extant lizards with extinct lizards, and we used the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) Red List to evaluate whether threatened species are larger than non-threatened species. We examined whether there were geographic or phylogenetic biases to extinction in this system. Results Quaternary extinctions were size-biased, with a higher incidence of extinction in large-bodied lizards; the same relationship exists between threatened and non-threatened present-day lizards. Biases in the fossil record do not drive this trend, as the body sizes of present-day lizards do not differ from those preserved in the fossil record. While there is no geographic variability in extinction, we find that there is lineage specificity, as the majority of extinctions occur within the family Leiocephalidae. At the family level, size alone does not explain extinction trends for most families, but our data suggest that large-bodied species in each family have a higher extinction risk than their smaller counterparts. Main conclusions Size-biased extinction trends in lizards mirror phenomena in other taxonomic groups, but additional life-history traits may play a role at the family level. We highlight the utility of fossil datasets in understanding extinction dynamics and underscore the urgency of a thorough assessment of extinction risk for insular lizards."
"Aim We test whether the modern regionalization of the angiosperm flora is the result of Cenozoic barriers to dispersal. Location Global. Methods We used a database of Cenozoic woody angiosperm fossils to build a matrix of family and genus occurrence at 11 continents/regions for five time periods of the Cenozoic, thus defining 55 floras. We used ordinations and cluster analyses to infer the relationships among these floras. We tested for the effects of time, land connections and dispersal barriers on the similarities between these woody angiosperm floras. Results For all time periods of the Cenozoic the world's woody angiosperm floras were grouped into three large clusters: a very compact Northern Hemisphere cluster (North America, Europe, temperate Asia and Palaeogene south China), a somewhat less compact Palaeotropical cluster (Africa, India, Southeast Asia and Neogene south China) and a rather diffuse Gondwanan cluster (Antarctica, Australia, New Zealand, temperate South America and the Neotropics). The primary clustering is evidently geographical, and reflects the barriers formed by the Tethys and the southern Atlantic-southern Indian oceans. There is evidence that the more recent Gondwanan floras are more divergent than the older floras, possibly due to long isolation by oceans and multiple extinction events, whereas the similarities among Northern Hemisphere floras increased during the Neogene. Main conclusions The modern regionalization is mainly the result of dispersal barriers that existed at diverse times in the Cenozoic, resulting in several woody angiosperm floras that evolved in parallel. Climatic change and dispersal also played important roles in shaping biogeographical patterns of Cenozoic woody angiosperms."
"Aim To disentangle the effects of environmental and geographical processes driving phylogenetic distances among clades of maritime pine (Pinus pinaster). To assess the implications for conservation management of combining molecular information with species distribution models (SDMs; which predict species distribution based on known occurrence records and on environmental variables). Location Western Mediterranean Basin and European Atlantic coast. Methods We undertook two cluster analyses for eight genetically defined pine clades based on climatic niche and genetic similarities. We assessed niche similarity by means of a principal component analysis and Schoener's D metric. To calculate genetic similarity, we used the unweighted pair group method with arithmetic mean based on Nei's distance using 266 single nucleotide polymorphisms. We then assessed the contribution of environmental and geographical distances to phylogenetic distance by means of Mantel regression with variance partitioning. Finally, we compared the projection obtained from SDMs fitted from the species level (SDMsp) and composed from the eight clade-level models (SDMcm). Results Genetically and environmentally defined clusters were identical. Environmental and geographical distances explained 12.6% of the phylogenetic distance variation and, overall, geographical and environmental overlap among clades was low. Large differences were detected between SDMsp and SDMcm (57.75% of disagreement in the areas predicted as suitable). Main conclusions The genetic structure within the maritime pine subspecies complex is primarily a consequence of its demographic history, as seen by the high proportion of unexplained variation in phylogenetic distances. Nevertheless, our results highlight the contribution of local environmental adaptation in shaping the lower-order, phylogeographical distribution patterns and spatial genetic structure of maritime pine: (1) genetically and environmentally defined clusters are consistent, and (2) environment, rather than geography, explained a higher proportion of variation in phylogenetic distance. SDMs, key tools in conservation management, better characterize the fundamental niche of the species when they include molecular information."
"Aim Tropical forests store 25% of global carbon and harbour 96% of the world's tree species, but it is not clear whether this high biodiversity matters for carbon storage. Few studies have teased apart the relative importance of forest attributes and environmental drivers for ecosystem functioning, and no such study exists for the tropics. Location Neotropics. Methods We relate aboveground biomass (AGB) to forest attributes (diversity and structure) and environmental drivers (annual rainfall and soil fertility) using data from 144,000 trees, 2050 forest plots and 59 forest sites. The sites span the complete latitudinal and climatic gradients in the lowland Neotropics, with rainfall ranging from 750 to 4350mmyear(-1). Relationships were analysed within forest sites at scales of 0.1 and 1 ha and across forest sites along large-scale environmental gradients. We used a structural equation model to test the hypothesis that species richness, forest structural attributes and environmental drivers have independent, positive effects on AGB. Results Across sites, AGB was most strongly driven by rainfall, followed by average tree stem diameter and rarefied species richness, which all had positive effects on AGB. Our indicator of soil fertility (cation exchange capacity) had a negligible effect on AGB, perhaps because we used a global soil database. Taxonomic forest attributes (i.e. species richness, rarefied richness and Shannon diversity) had the strongest relationships with AGB at small spatial scales, where an additional species can still make a difference in terms of niche complementarity, while structural forest attributes (i.e. tree density and tree size) had strong relationships with AGB at all spatial scales. Main conclusions Biodiversity has an independent, positive effect on AGB and ecosystem functioning, not only in relatively simple temperate systems but also in structurally complex hyperdiverse tropical forests. Biodiversity conservation should therefore be a key component of the UN Reducing Emissions from Deforestation and Degradation strategy."
"Aim Habitat heterogeneity has long been recognized as a key landscape characteristic determining biodiversity patterns. However, a lack of standardized, large-scale, high-resolution and temporally updatable heterogeneity information based on direct observations has limited our understanding of this connection and its effective use for biodiversity conservation. To address this, we develop here remote sensing-based metrics to characterize global habitat heterogeneity at 1-km resolution and assess their value for biodiversity modelling. Location Global. Methods We develop 14 heterogeneity metrics (available at ) based on the textural features of the enhanced vegetation index (EVI) imagery from the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS), and closely examine a complementary core set of six of these metrics. We evaluate their ability to provide fine-grain habitat heterogeneity by comparing the heterogeneity information captured by them with that measured by 30-m Landsat-based land-cover data. Using spatial autoregressive models, we then compare their utility with that of more conventional metrics (derived from topography or categorical land-cover data) for modelling the species richness of bird communities across the conterminous United States based on Breeding Bird Survey data. Results The newly derived metrics capture different aspects of habitat heterogeneity and provide fine-grain information for locations deemed homogeneous by traditional land-cover classifications at both continental and global extents. Most of them strongly exceed conventional heterogeneity variables in capturing the spatial variation in bird species richness, with Homogeneity emerging as the strongest predictor. Main conclusions This study develops and validates the performance of readily usable metrics of textural measures capturing fine-grain habitat heterogeneity. The presented metrics outperform conventional measures in capturing detailed spatial variation in habitats and in predicting key biodiversity patterns. They provide a rigorous and comparable basis for understanding heterogeneity-diversity relationships, and offer a powerful tool for monitoring and understanding the responses of biodiversity and ecosystems to the changing environment."
"Aim Despite predictions of high extinction risk resulting from climate change, range expansions have been documented more frequently than range retractions, prompting suggestions that species can endure climatic changes by persisting in cool or damp microclimates. We test whether such microrefugia' exist. Location The United Kingdom. Methods We examine fine-scale changes in the plant communities of a coastal grassland over a 30-year period in which spring temperatures increased by 1.4 degrees C. We look at whether changes in community composition and local colonizations and extinctions are related to microclimatic conditions. Results Our findings suggest that while community reassembly was consistent with warming, changes were smaller on cooler, north-facing slopes. Closer inspection of the patterns of species turnover revealed that species with low temperature requirements were able to persist on cooler slopes, while those with high moisture requirements suffered similar decreases in occupancy across all microclimates. Main conclusions Our results suggest that cooler slopes may act as microrefugia, buffering the effects on plant communities of increases in temperature by delaying extinctions of species with low temperature requirements."
"Aim Evidence is mounting that biological invasions profoundly alter the capacity of ecosystems to regulate or mitigate greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions - a crucial ecosystem service in a changing climate. However, the growing literature has revealed different, even contradictory results and the general pattern over large spatial scales remains obscure. This study synthesizes the effects of invasions by different alien taxa on major GHG emissions. Location Global. Methods A structured meta-analysis of 68 case studies was performed to determine the generality of the effects of biological invasions on emissions of three GHGs and assess the extent to which the heterogeneity of effects can be explained by recipient ecosystems, invasive taxa, functional traits, climate and methodological aspects. Results Invasive alien species increased N2O emissions but promoted carbon sequestration. Effects on CH4 emissions remained inconclusive. Given the general trends, effects differed by ecosystems, with greater N2O emissions in invaded forest and higher increase in carbon stock in invaded grassland. Invasive taxa also mediated the effects of invasions: invasive plants enhanced carbon storage whereas animal invaders consistently showed negative effects. Focusing on exotic plant invasions, N-fixing species caused greater N2O emissions than non-N-fixing species, and for carbon stock, N-fixing and woody plants exerted stronger positive effects than non-N-fixing and herbaceous plants, respectively. Moreover, climatic factors explained the variation in effects of exotic plant invasions but not those of animal invasions. The effects of plant invasions on carbon content varied nonlinearly with climate, with more pronounced effects where temperature and precipitation were extremely high or low. Main conclusions This meta-analysis reveals the overall magnitude and direction of the effects of biological invasions on major GHG emissions, demonstrates that the effects vary substantially by GHGs, biological and environmental factors and proposes avenues for future research. These results highlight the importance of considering species traits and local and climatic conditions in assessing and managing biological invaders."
"Landscape fragmentation is one of the consequences of increased socio-economic pressure facing many regions of the world today. The European Environment Agency published an assessment of fragmentation in 2011 on the scale of the entire continent, based on the effective mesh size. In this report, Romania is mentioned as an interesting case, and it is hypothesized that the true level of fragmentation was underestimated. The aim of the present study is to investigate this hypothesis. We chose Romania's Southern Carpathians as a case study, digitized the roads from orthophoto maps and calculated the effective mesh size. Results support the hypothesis formulated in the EEA report. Specifically, our results indicated an effective mesh size of approximately 50 km(2), which is comparable to other Eastern European countries, whereas the EEA reported an effective mesh size of approximately 1700 km(2), which is comparable to the values in Scandinavian countries. To our knowledge, this is the first time that hypotheses stated in an EEA report have been tested against local data. The analyses demonstrate the potential of local data to refine analyses realized at a European level. Because our study area faces increased pressure from local roads for forestry and recreation, accurate fragmentation results are crucial. Our results may help planners to ensure that road development is sustainable and biodiversity conserved. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved."

"Under the context of climate change adaption research, vulnerability assessment should take into consideration the interaction among natural processes, socio-economic conditions, and the mechanisms of response of the integrated ecological economic system. Pressure from urban development, land use and land cover change along the western coast of Taiwan not only has caused the loss of ecosystem services in pen-urban environments, but has also resulted in an increase in urban flooding vulnerability. This paper develops a framework, which incorporates the interaction among exposure, sensitivity, and adaptive capacity for assessing the vulnerability to flooding. To achieve this aim, this research interprets urban flooding vulnerability based on emergy concepts and develops emergy indices to assess the spatiality of urban flooding vulnerability in Taiwan's western coastal plain via GIS. Based on the results of the emergy evaluation of the three components of vulnerability and five emergy indices for urban flooding vulnerability, the areas with intense urbanization are characterized with high potential impact to flood. However, cities with higher potential impact do not necessarily lead to higher vulnerability for urban flooding because adaptive capacity can also mitigate the vulnerability of cities to extreme climate events. Using the framework developed by this research we show that the emergy concept can effectively provide a common measuring unit for evaluating exposure, sensitivity and adaptive capacity of urban flooding vulnerability.

"Green roof substrates are usually designed to achieve desirable characteristics such as low bulk density, preparation cost, high water holding capacity (WHC), hydraulic conductivity (HC) and airfilled porosity (AFP). However, no importance is given to sorption capacity or leaching potential of substrate. Thus, in the present study, novel attempt was made to incorporate a brown-seaweed (Turbinaria conoides) in growth substrate to enhance the runoff quality from green roofs. The green roof substrate, prepared using 30% perlite, 20% vermiculite, 10% sand, 20% crushed brick, 10% cocopeat and 10% T. conoides, was found to have favourable characteristics such as low bulk density (477.7 kg/m(3)), high WHC (49.5%), AFP (20.5%) and HC (4210 mm/h). With the aid of down-flow fixed column, sorption capacity of green roof substrate towards various metal ions (Na, K, Ca, Mg, Al, Fe, Cd, Cu, Cr, Ni, Pb and Zn) was examined and results indicated that the column was able to operate for 1440 min at a flow rate of 5 mL/min before outlet Ni concentration reached the inlet. Green roof experiments were performed using pilot-scale assemblies with Portulaca grandiflora as vegetation. Under rainfall simulations, it was observed that vegetated-green roof assemblies acted as a sink for various metal ions and produced better runoff. In addition, green roofs buffered acidic rain and delayed runoff generation. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved."
"Vegetation and trees in particular play a key role in mitigating thermal load in urban areas. The goals of this study were to analyse species-specific microclimatic effects and to identify the role of leaf-area-density, transpiration, and stomatal conductance for cooling effects at urban sites. Air temperature, relative humidity and surface temperature were used to study the effects of six tree species with similar age structure in a residential area with comparable site conditions. Transpiration, stomatal conductance and leaf-area density were measured during the summer months in 2013. Air temperatures and relative humidity were monitored for four trees per street in hourly intervals, and surface temperatures were recorded in the afternoon for three hot days on the shaded and unshaded asphalt surfaces beneath the trees. Species differ significantly in their ability to reduce air and surface temperatures, as well as to increase relative humidity. Trees showing both a high leaf-area density and a high rate of transpiration are more effective in cooling the air temperatures. Differences in the surface temperatures of the tree shaded areas are more pronounced compared to the air temperatures. Thus, the surface temperatures of the full sun exposed areas are up to 15.2 K warmer than that in the tree shaded areas. The results provide information to decrease thermal load in urban areas for future tree planting by choosing species with high cooling potential. The highest cooling potential was measured for Corylus colurna and Tilia cordata 'Greenspire' and the lowest for Ulmus x hollandica 'Lobel'. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved."
"Land use and different scales of spatial data aggregation are important for integrated urban water modelling. Inadequacy of land use classification in such models, however, prompted development of a new water-centric classification. A thirteen-category system (considering land cover, utilisation, and urban zoning aspects) was devised and applied to Melbourne, Australia. Sensitivity of the classification to spatial aggregation was tested by analysing randomly sampled subsets of Melbourne's urban fabric for variation in landscape patterns, land use dominance and fragmentation. Significant differences were found when comparing inner city (highly fragmented, dominated by many land use categories) to fringes, (only few dominant categories e.g. residential, reserves), which are challenging to accurately represent in urban water models if oversimplified. The new classification encompasses key integrated urban water management aspects, but does not capture local-scale features of the urban environment. Significant shortcomings for using spatial aggregation methods to simplify data for urban water models were found. Solely focussing on spatial coverage of land use instead of land use mix neglects important water interactions between categories (e.g. open space and residential). Trade-offs between spatial resolution and computational efficiency, for example, can degrade accuracy of representing urban water characteristics as less-dominant land uses are systematically removed. Finally, spatial aggregation methods likely result in the loss of minor (yet important) land uses (e.g. Civic). More effective methods for representing the variability of urban environments, which depart from simple aggregated rasters and sole reliance on land use, may be required to better define urban complexity in our water models.

"Ecosystem health assessment is always one of the key topics of ecosystem management. However, few studies has focused on assessing ecosystem health of landscapes, which are geo-spatial units composed of different kinds of ecosystem mosaics. Healthy ecosystems should sustainably provide a range of ecosystem services to meet human needs, and such a concept often cannot be expressed using the traditional ecosystem health assessment. Using Shenzhen City in China as a case study area, this research aims to assess the ecosystem health of urban landscapes based on ecosystem services. Results showed a distinct deterioration of urban ecosystem health for all of the 30 units assessed in Shenzhen City during 1978-2005. Five levels were classified with respect to health using fixed thresholds. There were 12 towns appearing with the worst level and 4 towns disappearing with the best level in 2005 compared with the status in 1978. Although there was no significant decrease in the level of health during 1978-2000, by 2005 more than 70% of towns belonged to the top two levels, classifying them as unhealthy. Among all the assessing indicators, the indicators of ecosystem organization contributed least to ecosystem health, except in 1986, and ecosystem services were found to be the most contributive indicator during 1978-2005. It was also suggested that land use patterns provided an integrating bridge among regional ecosystem health, economic development, and environmental performances. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

"Halting the 'extinction of experience', the progressive disengagement of people with the natural world, is vital to human health and wellbeing and to public support for global biological conservation. Home to the majority of humanity, urban areas are the key for engaging people with nature, raising the crucial question of how cities should best be designed to facilitate these experiences. For the purposes of maintaining local biodiversity, intensive development within a small area (land sparing) has been shown to be better than extensive development over a large area (land sharing). Here, we investigated for the first time how different city forms affect people's experience of nature, measured in terms of their use of greenspaces. We selected five pairs of land-sharing and land-sparing study regions with different coverage by greenspaces within the city of Tokyo, central Japan and used a questionnaire survey to determine the use residents made of these spaces. We found the frequency of people's recreational use of urban greenspaces was higher in urban land-sharing than land-sparing regions. Moreover, satisfaction with local green environments was also higher in land-sharing regions. This suggests a potential conflict in the design of cities between the urban form that is most desirable for the direct protection of regional biodiversity, and that which best promotes people's nature experiences and the support for its wider protection. A strong emphasis on the advantages of land sparing may increase the separation of humans from nature, and further reduce public interest in, and awareness of, biodiversity and its benefits.

"The intricate interrelationships between environment and society result in unique landscapes, each with its own development patterns and rates. While many studies have focused on how development impacts the environment; this study quantifies the influence of the environment, relative to human historical factors, on long-term (1857-2030) and large-scale (10,000 km(2)) development patterns in a region with diverse physiography. A major component of this paper is the development of a Magnitude of Relative Change (MRC) equation to empirically measure long-term development trends and rates at regional scale in relation to multiple physiographic factors. We simulated past urban development trends and forecasted future patterns for the central Arkansas (USA) region using a modified SLEUTH-3r urban growth model. In doing this, we investigated the relationships and feedbacks between physiographic settings of the study area and past and future development patterns. Another vital component of this research is the adoption of an environmental historical approach to examine and evaluate development dynamics within and among ecoregions. Our analytical approach emphasizes the potential of environmental forces to influence land development transitions and at the same time appreciates the role of human advancements on shaping those dynamics.

"An increasing number of studies have sought to identify disparities or inequalities in the distribution of urban parks and green spaces. Results of these analyses have diverged considerably depending on the method used to assess accessibility. In this article, we revisit an increasingly popular technique, the two-step floating catchment area (2SFCA) method, and modify it to better align with the ways in which parks are planned and intended to be used. In this respect, we develop a Variable-width Floating Catchment Area (VFCA) method that models park attractiveness as a function of its size and number of amenities. We further compare accessibility according to four modes of transportation: bicycling, driving, public transit, and walking. A case study on access to public parks in Mecklenburg County, North Carolina, the U.S. is performed. In general, walking access to parks is found to be low throughout the county, access to larger regional parks is greatest for outlying suburban areas, and center city residents have access to a greater number of park amenities. Study results are compared to those obtained when using the original 2SFCA and indicate important differences in spatial accessibility patterns. Consequently, caution must be adopted when choosing a spatial access model and interpreting the resulting spatial patterns of accessibility. The parameters of the VFCA can easily be set to different values, making it a tool for scenario analyses. This study further improves our understanding regarding accessibility to public parks, which can help develop effective planning strategies. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved."
"The article aims at revealing the role of green space diversity and the mix of neighborhood services on the price of residential land in Luxembourg. We use a multilevel approach to estimate a hedonic model in order to benefit from the hierarchical structure of the data and to reveal spatial heterogeneity in the valuation of these neighborhood qualities. In addition to standard accessibility and socio-economic variables, we include geographical variables in the form of neighborhood mix indices and a Shannon diversity index of land-uses. Via a spatial cross-regressive specification we also test whether our nested levels are able to capture most of the spatial dependence. Our results show that the presence of a mix of services and green space does not directly impact prices, but that the diversity of land-uses (Shannon index) matters, and has negative effects when considered within immediate proximity and positive effects within a walking distance. Land use effects however vary spatially and emphasize the contrast between regions that are particularly attractive and picturesque, and the former industrial conurbation. In our case we also show the ability of the multilevel approach to capture spatial auto-correlation effects. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved."
"In recent years, a series of studies have highlighted the positive effects of urban green on individual activity behaviour and health. In this paper, we examine salutogenic environment effects of urban green upon walking behaviour and how such effects are mediated by built environment configuration and street-level physical accessibility. The dwelling locations of N = 15,354 respondents of the London Travel Demand Survey were geocoded and individual walking behaviour was extracted from the travel diary. A 0.5-m resolution normalized difference vegetation (NDVI) index derived from spectral reflectance measurements in remotely sensed colour infrared data was employed as an objective measure of greenness, while density of street trees acted as proxy of perceived environmental quality in street corridors. A network model of street-level physical accessibility was developed using spatial Design Network Analysis (sDNA). Logistic regression models reported a significant association of odds of walking with density of street trees and street-level betweenness (a measure of street network connectivity), while sensitivity analyses with continuous regression models for participants doing some walking indicated beneficial associations of distance walked with NDVI greenness and street trees. The results illustrate the necessity for targeted intervention strategies in activity-friendly planning via greening and optimized physical design of urban built environments. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

"Land take due to the rapid growth of urban areas is an issue of global concern. It calls for sound monitoring methodologies to quantify the phenomenon, with a view to verify the effectiveness of urban growth management strategies. To this end, we propose an integrated statistical approach, coupling point sampling and mapping techniques, to estimate the number and size of urban areas, in a given territory, on successive occasions. Urban areas classification is based on all land cover classes contributing to urban structure, and is more comprehensive than assessments based on sealed surfaces only. The devised approach is here tested to quantify land take by urban expansion during 1990-2008 in the Metropolitan City of Rome (Central Italy). Urban areas coverage increased from 15.4% in 1990 to approximately 20.4% in 2008. During this period, 11,000 ha, mainly agricultural land, were taken by urban sprawl in Rome's municipality. This occurred despite the fact that population had remained stable. Our findings also indicate that the average land take per-capita in Rome municipality is about four times higher than the average value of urban residential area per capita of mid-to-large European cities. We therefore discuss the potential of the proposed method for a reliable monitoring of urban expansion, in order to support sustainable urban management and to highlight factors underpinning unregulated urban development.

"The depth of growing media on green roofs can strongly influence plant growth and survival. The setting of the roof, including wind exposure, shading and the nature of the building below the green roof can also impact microclimate and plant performance, but the effects of roof setting have been little investigated. We conducted a five-year experiment in which green roofs differing in substrate depth and the nature of the underlying and surrounding structures (heated/air-conditioned vs. non-air-conditioned space underneath; height of green roof relative to roof surface) were planted with the same mixture of 11 species. After five years with no irrigation or weeding, planted species were still present in all treatments, but communities were dominated by ruderal species that colonized from the surrounding area. Both substrate depth and exposure affected plant community composition with exposure making a larger difference. Plant community change was greatest after the driest year of the study, suggesting that substrate depth and exposure largely exerted influence over plant communities via drought. The system installed over non-air-conditioned space had much more variable substrate temperatures and higher maximum and lower minimum temperatures. Installation of green roofs over non-air-conditioned spaces and over well-insulated buildings is common and the effects on plants of more extreme microclimates caused by these roof settings should be incorporated into plant selection criteria.

"In recent years, applying ecological concepts into landscape designs to enhance biodiversity within urban areas has become an important strategy worldwide. A commonly adopted strategy for the development of systems is to estimate the ecological effectiveness of relative landscape mosaics. Biotope Area Factor (BAF) is a general methodology that is used, however it only considers the land use surface types of the landscape mosaic unit using aerial photos and expert questionnaire method. It is not clear whether the ecological effectiveness of areas estimated by BAF system is congruent with the actual ecological characteristics and diversity of inhabiting organisms. The practicality of the BAF systems are evaluated in this study by comparing the BAF values of homogenous units amongst eight urban university campuses in central Taiwan with vegetation density/structure and arthropod/plant diversity collected in situ. We used linear models to evaluate the relationship between BAF values and in situ arthropod/plant diversities and vegetation structures. The results showed that BAF values of various homogenous units were partially correlated with vegetation structure, but were incongruent with in situ diversity of plants and arthropod. Our findings indicated that the current urban area ecological effectiveness quantifying BAF system may not be appropriate. For future studies, we suggest that the operation scale should be adjusted and factors influencing biodiversity should be considered in the weighting system to realistically and precisely designate the ecological effectiveness of landscape mosaic units.

"This study uses multilevel logit models to analyze the impact of urban greenway projects on land use in Seoul, Korea. Results derived from the use of land use change models confirm that the conversion of land from single-family residential use to commercial use is more likely to occur within 1.5 km of the Cheong Gye Cheon (CGC) greenway pedestrian entrances; conversions from single-family housing to mixed use appeared to a lesser extent within the same distance bands. However, land used for single-family housing could be converted to high-rises and dense housing (condominiums) within the band 3-4 km from the entrances. In addition, commercial land is more likely to be converted to mixed use land within 500 m of the CGC corridor entrances, while mixed use land tends to be converted into commercial land within the 1.5-km band and within 3.5-4 km of the pedestrian entrance along the urban greenway. These results suggest that urban greenway infrastructure can effectively encourage higher-density residential and commercial development. Furthermore, appealing amenities in the greenway attract people and firms and thus promote the demand for further property development. Finally, this study confirms that we need to keep a holistic view in linking the urban greenway, land use patterns, and transportation systems for sustainable and livable cities.

"Green roofs have received considerable attention for multiple ecosystem services which include stormwater amelioration. Offering sustainable stormwater source-control, green roofs utilize otherwise unused impervious urban surfaces to restore pre-development hydrologic functions such as infiltration and retention. Its ability to retain stormwater is related to external and internal factors. Meteorological conditions prior to a rainfall event can influence antecedent evapotranspiration, the only water-exit pathway of the green-roof system besides discharge. Whereas evapotranspiration may be difficult and costly to measure directly, other common meteorological conditions can be monitored conveniently and inexpensively even prior to actual green-roof installation. Identifying salient on-site meteorological factors may provide valuable insights into hydrologic dynamics, and inform green-roof design and planning decisions. A statistical regression approach identified potential antecedent meteorological factors and moisture indicators of extensive green-roof retention. Continuous field-monitoring data revealed the combined effects of rainfall depth, wind speed, solar radiation, and antecedent dry weather period to explain the measured stormwater retention under a humid subtropical rainfall regime. Amongst the studied environmental factors, solar radiation and wind speed contributed notably to green-roof stormwater retention and may provide a dependable basis to assist green-roof site selection when resources are limited. It is important to incorporate site-specific planning and assessment prior to green infrastructure design and implementation to maximize hydrologic and evaporative cooling services in cities with complex topographical features.

"Long-term survival and growth of urban forests are critical to achieve the targeted benefits of urban tree planting programs, such as building energy savings from tree shade. However, little is known about how trees perform in the long-term, especially in residential areas. Given this gap in the literature, we monitored 22-years of post-planting survival, growth, and energy saving performance of shade trees in Sacramento, California. Using field surveys, aerial photo interpretation and survival analysis, we calculated cumulative survivorship and compared measured with projected tree growth. Using Shadow Pattern Simulator and Micropas (building energy simulation), combined with survival and growth observations, we modeled the current energy savings produced by the program trees and then compared this result with initial projections from the early years of the program. The 22-year post planting survivorship was 42.4%, considerably less than the initial projection. On average, measured growth rates were within expected ranges to provide shading benefits; 22-year old trees reached 74.6% and 68.8% of the projected 30-year mature size for tree heights and crown diameters, respectively. Annual energy savings were 107 kWh per property and 80 kWh per tree, which were 23% and 52% of the initial projection, respectively. Lower survivorship was the primary factor influencing lower cooling savings. Medium-sized trees had higher survivorship and growth attainment compared to other trees. This study contributes to more accurate quantification of urban greening performance, helping urban forest managers make data-driven decisions. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved."
"We applied a geographic approach to the analysis of current food-related behaviors in pen-urban Bangkok, Thailand, to better understand potential for building a local food system for sustainable peri-urban agriculture during a period of rapid urbanization. We addressed three main working questions: (I) Do traditional wet markets keep functioning as an important hub for vegetable and fruit food systems under the influence of modern supermarkets? (2) How ""local"" are the current food-related behaviors of multiple actors? (3) How do the distributions of food-related actors and their environments change in this period of rapid urbanization in pen-urban areas? We combined field based interviews of multiple actors, including farming and non-farming households, wet market retailers, and food shop owners with a GIS analysis of food-related activities and land use changes. We found that the traditional food system played an important role as both a food source for households and a selling destination for farmers. Wet market, a hub in traditional food system, spread across pen-urban areas and kept increasing under urbanization. There was, however, little connection between farmers and nearby wet markets in the same district and it constricted positive feedbacks between producers and consumers in pen-urban areas. Promoting communication between farmers and nearby retailers will contribute to better governance of a local food system and subsequent long-term conservation of pen-urban farmlands.

"Urban parks and gardens may be failing to meet the diverse ""nature needs"" of a growing global urban population. Informal urban greenspace (IGS) such as vacant lots, street or railway verges and riverbanks may provide space for unstructured recreation and nature contact. Yet we know little about residents' relationship with IGS outside of Europe and North America, what factors influence IGS use and evaluation, or what role geographic and cultural context play. Our paper combines qualitative and quantitative methods to examine how residents in Brisbane, Australia (n = 123) and Sapporo, Japan (n = 163) perceive, evaluate and use IGS. Using statistical methods (e.g. correlation analysis) we analyzed what factors influence how respondents interact with IGS, including the amount of formal greenspace within 500m of survey locations using a GIS buffer analysis. Results were tested for differences and similarities between the cities. We found that respondents knew of IGS in their neighborhood (>80%), appreciated and used it (>30%), but more respondents in Brisbane used and appreciated IGS. The influence of demographic factors and local formal greenspace area was limited, but respondents' attitude towards urban nature was correlated with IGS evaluation. Littering was perceived as IGS' most common problem (90% of respondents), but was reported by <20% of IGS users. Geographic (e.g., IGS type prevalence) and cultural (e.g., human-nature relationship) contexts represented potential influence factors. We argue that the liminal nature of IGS (e.g., liability) management poses a challenge traditional greenspace planning. To address this problem, further research should explore participatory management approaches. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved."
"Urban stream condition is often degraded by human activities in the surrounding watershed. Given the complexity of urban areas, relationships among variables that cause stream degradation can be difficult to isolate. We examined factors affecting stream condition by evaluating social, terrestrial, stream hydrology and water quality variables from 20 urban stream watersheds in central Iowa, U.S.A. We used path analysis to examine and quantify social and ecological factors related to variation in stream conditions. Path models supported hypotheses that stream water quality was influenced by variables in each category. Specifically, one path model indicated that increased stream water conductivity was linked to high road density, which itself was associated with high human population density. A second path model revealed nitrogen concentration in stream water was positively related to watershed area covered by cropland, and that cropland increased as human population density declined. A third path model indicated phosphorus concentration in stream water declined as percent of watershed residents with college education increased, although the mechanism underlying this relationship was unclear and could have been an artifact of lower soil-derived nutrient input from watersheds dominated by paved surfaces. To improve environmental conditions in urban streams, land use planning strategies should include limiting or reducing road density near streams, installing treatment trains for surface water runoff associated with roads, and establishing vegetated buffer zones to reduce inputs of road salt and other pollutants. Additionally, education/outreach should be conducted with residents to increase understanding of how their own behaviors influence stream water quality. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved."
"Two common forms of traditional land use systems in Mediterranean landscapes are dehesa and hedged fields. Both are agroforestry systems in which domestic stock are pastured: amongst parklike trees in dehesa, and in enclosures surrounded by stone walls and woody vegetation in hedged fields. The latter are now tending to be replaced by dehesa due to labour costs. Here, we investigate the boundary layer microclimate and environmental characteristics of these two land uses in order to evaluate the respective differences in relation to climate modification, soil organic carbon, and soil water content. Fraxinus angustifolia-dominated sites were investigated in the Guadarrama mountains, Spain, in high summer with simultaneous sampling under trees in both dehesa and hedgerows and in adjacent open fields. Whilst temperature profiles were similar in both systems, hedgerows had higher soil water content, lower wind speeds, and higher total soil organic carbon compared to dehesa, and moreover these trends also applied to open fields of the respective systems. We conclude that not only do hedged fields have advantages over dehesa for shelter and production, but that the climatic modifications of hedged field systems potentially modify boundary layer climates on a broader scale than both individual fields and dehesa. Thus, the conservation of hedged field systems provides natural capital and broad environmental gains. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved."
"Forest fragmentation is a landscape-level process that consists of two interdependent components: forest loss and spatial pattern changes to which species respond differently. Efficient programs to conserve native biodiversity require a sound understanding of the relation between forest cover and the spatial pattern of forest fragments, but these issues remain almost unknown for subtropical ecosystems. We examine the forest fragmentation of the Gran Chaco in central Argentina over the last 30 years. In particular, we quantify forest loss and spatial pattern changes using random sampling techniques on multi-temporal forest cover maps (1979, 1999 and 2010). We analyzed forest fragmentation according to the following steps: (i) selection of fragmentation pattern indices (Pis), (ii) sampling on forest cover maps and PIs calculation, (iii) statistical comparison by bootstrapping, and (iv) trajectory analysis. During the last three decades, forest cover declined dramatically (similar to 90%) and the selected pattern metrics (MPS, PD, ED) varied significantly (p < 0.05). The results depict a devastating situation of Gran Chaco forests with a progressive reduction to few small fragments during the last decades. Furthermore when forest loss exceeded the similar to 50% of the total land area, the temporal trajectories of the selected PIs underwent an abrupt change. Distinguishing habitat spatial pattern changes from forest loss over time supports the identification of specific conservation actions and provide the basis to establish the lower threshold of forest cover and the more effective arrangement of fragments necessary to mitigate the fragmentation effects.

"Evolving literature suggests that modifiable neighborhood characteristics such as trees and other vegetation are inversely associated with crime. This study examines the relationship between vegetation and crime in New Haven, CT, a midsized city with high crime rates. Spatial lag analyses were used to test the association of tree canopy coverage, measured through high-resolution aerial imagery, with rates of violent (murder, rape, robbery and assault), property (burglary, theft, motor vehicle theft and arson) and total (violent + property) crimes. Greater tree canopy coverage was associated with lower rates of violent, property and total crime, independent of block group level educational attainment, median household income, racial/ethnic composition, population density, vacancies and renter-occupied housing, as well as spatial autocorrelation. Results support the general findings from studies conducted in larger cities, including Chicago, Portland, Baltimore and Philadelphia and points toward trees' crime prevention potential.

"Understanding the causes and consequences of land use and land cover change in drylands is crucial for global sustainability. Inner Mongolia consists of arid and semiarid ecosystems of global importance. Our main goal was twofold: to review the patterns and drivers of land use and land cover change in Inner Mongolia, and to discuss ecological impacts and strategies for promoting landscape and regional sustainability. We took an interdisciplinary and retrospective approach, based on historical records and remote sensing data. Inner Mongolia has evolved from an ocean to a forested region and then to a dryland area in the past millions of years. As a cradle of Chinese civilization, Inner Mongolia has experienced a series of land transitions from localized primitive agriculture that occurred in prehistoric times to broad-scale nomadic pastoralism that lasted for a few 1000 years, and to sedentary pastoralism with increasing agriculture and urbanization since the 1960s. The general land use pattern has long been shaped by the interactions between nomadic pastoralism and agrarian culture. The major drivers of land use and land cover change include: climate, demography, socioeconomic structures, institutional changes, and technological innovations. The landscapes of Inner Mongolia have evolved historically through several phases, and the profound and unsustainable landscape transformations during the past 50 years have been driven primarily by land use policies. Strategies based on landscape sustainability science are needed to curb ecosystem degradation and promote sustainability in the region."
"The Mongolian Plateau, comprising the nation of Mongolia and the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region of China, has been influenced by significant climatic changes and intensive human activities. Previous satellite-based analyses have suggested an increasing tendency in the vegetation cover over recent decades. However, several ground-based observations have indicated a decline in vegetation production. This study aimed to explore long-term changes in vegetation greenness and land surface phenology in relation to changes in temperature and precipitation on the Plateau between 1982 and 2011 using the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI). Across the Plateau, a significantly positive trend in the growing season (May-September) NDVI was observed from 1982 to 1998, but since that time, the NDVI has not shown a persistent increase, thus causing an insignificant trend over the entire study period. For the steppe vegetation (a major vegetation type on the Plateau), the NDVI increased significantly in spring but decreased in summer. Precipitation was the dominant factor related to changes in steppe vegetation. Warming in spring contributed to earlier vegetation green-up only in meadow steppe vegetation, implying that water deficiency in typical and desert steppe vegetation may eliminate the effect of warming. Our results also suggest a combined effect of climatic and non-climatic factors and highlight the need to examine the role of regional human activities in the control of vegetation dynamics."
"Desertification in China has become one of the most serious ecological and social problems. The four mega-sandy lands (Hulunbeir, Horqin, Otindag, and Mu Us) in Inner Mongolia are reported to be the most widespread and seriously desertified areas in China. To explore changes of vegetation activity and the possible driving forces in the four mega-sandy lands over the last three decades. We investigated spatiotemporal variations in the growing-season (May-September) normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) and their relationships with climate factors and human activities during 1982-2011, using two NDVI datasets from Global Inventory Modelling and Mapping Studies (GIMMS) and Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS). We found a significant overall NDVI increase in Mu Us, but no such trends in the other three. A significant increase was in south and northeast Mu Us and southeast Horqin, and a decrease in south Hulunbeir, northwest Horqin, and central Otindag. NDVI trends were positively correlated with precipitation and uncorrelated with temperature and wind speed in all sandy lands except Mu Us. NDVI trends showed a large spatial heterogeneity in the four sandy lands. Precipitation was a major determiner for the interannual variations and spatial patterns of NDVI at regional scale, whereas human activities were the cause of NDVI variations at local scale. The consistent interannual variations between two NDVI datasets of GIMMS and MODIS for all four sandy lands suggested that GIMMS NDVI was appropriate for investigating long-term vegetation changes in sandy lands."
"Shrub encroachment in grasslands will lead to a mosaic landscape with shrub patches interspaced with grass patches and thus alters local and regional water and heat balance. Syntheses on effects of the climate and native grassland community on the shrub-encroached grassland (SEG) are very limited at a large scale. In this study we examined the variation of their community characteristics in the Inner Mongolian grasslands, using 192 SEG plots data from field survey during 2012-2013. Our results indicated that shrub cover and patch size exhibit a significant increase with longitude, but showed a hump-shaped latitudinal pattern. Shrub patch density and herb abundance were negative associated with latitude and longitude, whereas plant height showed an opposite trend. Such geographical patterns were likely co-determined by climate and native vegetation. Precipitation was the major controller for shrub cover and patch size, and temperature was the primary factor influencing shrub height and patch density. Consequently, shrub cover and patch size were greater at dry and warm habitats than at moist and cool sites. In addtion, native vegetation also significantly influenced the variations in that of shrub patches. Diverse habitats with tall vegetation were likely more resistant to shrub encroachment. Furthermore, although we did not fully evaluate the effects of soils on SEGs, the discussion on the soil-SEG relationship suggests an important role of soils in characterizing SEG structures. Our study provides the first regional assessment on the variations of SEG structures, and has an implication in the regional shrub expansion management and control."
"Many factors have been shown to affect species assemblages of a community, but studies using long-term spatial-temporal community data are still lacking. In this study, by using population abundance data of 14 rodent species over 25 years in 21 sampling sites, we investigated the effects of taxonomic relation, density dependency, species interaction and climate variation in determining spatial-temporal species assemblages of rodents in arid grasslands of Inner Mongolia in China. By the use of GAMM analysis, we found that intraspecific interactions were more common and more significant than interspecific interactions. Negative interactions between species of the same genus were more common than negative interactions between species of different genera. Dominant species show negative interactions on less abundant or rare species. Positive interactions often occur within rare or less abundant species. Through cluster analysis, we found species assemblages of rodent communities are well explained by assemblages of environmental variables, and species of same genus tend not to occur together as compared to species of the same family. Our results indicate that resource partitioning through intra- or interspecific competition and environmental filtering by climate and vegetation are important forces in shaping the spatial-temporal community structure and the dynamics of small mammal populations in an arid grassland landscape."
"Grasshoppers are a dominant herbivore assemblage globally and play an important role for ecosystem nutrient cycling. Yet, we lack a strong understanding of the relationship between grasshopper diversity and plant community composition at the landscape scale. Our aim was to test landscape scale relationships between plant and grasshopper communities. We used a large-scale, replicated experiment at four sites, including grazed and protected pastures across a 350 km transect and 200-400 mm precipitation gradient in the steppes of Inner Mongolia, China. We analyzed the relationships between plant and grasshopper parameters with ANOVAs and CCA. We collected 17 grasshopper species and 15,000+ individuals. The desert steppe (lowest precipitation) had the lowest grasshopper richness and diversity, but abundance was not different from the other sites. In two dry sites (desert steppe and Stipa steppe), livestock grazing decreased grasshopper diversity and increased abundance of the main pest species. In contrast, at the highest precipitation site (meadow steppe), grasshopper communities did not differ between grazing levels. Across all sites and grazing intensities, grasshopper abundance tended to be lowest and diversity highest in plant communities with intermediate levels of biomass and plant species richness. These results support the concept that appropriate land use management practices would be beneficial for increasing biodiversity, promoting grassland sustainability, and reducing outbreaks of the dominant pest grasshopper in Inner Mongolia. Our study suggests that different management approaches are necessary depending on the average annual precipitation and that the driest sites are most vulnerable to disturbance."
"Our understanding of the patterns and drivers of soil microbial communities at the regional scale remains inadequate although both have been extensively studied in plant communities. In this study, we examined the patterns and drivers of soil microbial communities using data from 24 arid and semi-arid ecosystem sites, covering a broad range of community types, soils, and climates on the Mongolian Plateau. Our findings demonstrated that, at the regional scale, the total soil microbial biomass, fungal biomass, bacterial biomass, and actinomycete biomass increased with mean annual precipitation, soil organic carbon (SOC), total soil nitrogen (TSN), C:N ratio, annual aboveground net primary productivity (ANPP), and root biomass. However, these values decreased with increasing soil pH and mean annual temperature and showed hump-shaped relationships with plant species richness (SR) and ANPP. Variations in soil microbial communities were associated with precipitation, plant community (SR, ANPP, and BB), and soil properties (SOC, TSN, and pH). At the local scale in a typical steppe, water addition by 30 % increased the total microbial biomass by 20 %, bacterial biomass by 16 %, and actinomycete biomass by 54 %. The increased microbial biomass, however, was still 25-41 % lower than that in the meadow steppe that received similar amount rainfall, indicating that, apart from the dominant effect of precipitation, plant community and soil properties could also regulate soil microbial communities. Our findings have important implications for understanding the impacts of climate change (e.g., precipitation) on soil microbial communities and linkages to ecosystem functioning in the Inner Mongolia grasslands and elsewhere."
"Soil moisture and temperature are known to be the two environmental constraints regulating mineralization of soil organic carbon (SOC). However, it remains unclear to what extent the moisture, temperature, and other abiotic and biotic factors affect the mineralization of SOC across broad geographic regions. Here, we examined the effects of multiple abiotic and biotic factors on SOC mineralization across 12 widespread arid and semiarid ecosystems on the Mongolia plateau, by using an integrative approach combining short-term laboratory incubations (28-day), field survey, and structure equation modeling (SEM). Our results showed that soil moisture had a predominant control on SOC mineralization across all sites. The average CO2 emissions over all sites increased by 23 % from 30 to 60 % water filled pore space (WFPS) and by 176 % from 60 to 90 % WFPS. Under conditions of 25 A degrees C and 60 % WFPS, the cumulative CO2-C emissions in the topsoil (0-20 cm) diminished in the following order: meadow steppe (227 mg kg(-1)) > typical steppe (216 mg kg(-1)) > desert (99 mg kg(-1)) > desert steppe (72 mg kg(-1)). The temperature sensitivity of SOC mineralization (Q(10)), the proportional change in carbon mineralization rate given a 10 A degrees C temperature gradient, was highest under conditions of low temperature and high moisture, but it was lowest under high temperature and low moisture. The SEM analyses demonstrate that the mineralization potential of SOC seems to be directly regulated by microbe activity and substrate availability. Climatic factors (e.g. mean annual precipitation, mean annual temperature), above- and belowground biomass, and soil pH, which regulate SOC and microbial biomass carbon content, also indirectly influence the SOC mineralization. Our results indicate that global climate change, particularly the increase in the frequency of extreme storms and droughts, will substantially affect SOC mineralization and ecosystem carbon cycle in arid and semiarid regions."
"Long-term monitoring of plant community composition and productivity provides evidence of how ecosystems respond to climate change. This study investigated the long-term (1981-2011) dynamics of plant species richness (SR) and community composition of a temperate grassland in Inner Mongolia, China, after the exclusion of livestock grazing. During the 30 years, SR increased between 1981 and 1991, and then declined from 1992 to 2011 mainly because of the loss of C-3 forbs as a result of decreasing rainfall and increasing temperature. The relative abundance, measured as relative biomass (RB), of plant functional groups also showed a similar temporal pattern. There was a shift in the RB of both dominant species and functional groups. As temperature increased with decreasing rainfall during the last 20 years of the study period, the abundance of C-3 forbs decreased, while C-4 grasses increased. However, shrub species did not show any significant pattern in their dynamics. Redundancy analysis indicated that the species composition and plant relative abundance of the Inner Mongolian grassland were affected by both precipitation and temperature. Our findings help us better understand how grassland ecosystems respond to future climate change on the Mongolian Plateau where the climate is projected to be drier and hotter in the upcoming decades."
"The link between environmental heterogeneity and diversity is a major tenet of plant ecology. Previous studies designed to test the heterogeneity-diversity hypothesis largely have only included measures characterizing the overall variation in habitat (e.g., CV of soil parameters). Rarely has the spatial structure of that variation been considered in relation to diversity. Here we examined the spatial variability (CV) and spatial structure of that variation (i.e. spatial scale of patchiness) of several main soil variables (C, N, P, pH, and conductivity) in relation to grassland plant species richness and diversity (H'). We determined the relationships of plant species richness and diversity at two spatial scales (50 x 50 m plot scale, 1 x 1 m quadrat scale) with the whole-plot soil heterogeneity within an similar to 750 ha natural area of Kerqin grasslands in northeastern China. We found that the best models describing species richness at the 0.25 ha and 1 m(2) scales included patch size of soil conductivity and N, respectively. For each of the two spatial scales, pairs of models best described H'; a simple regression with CV of soil N and a multiple regression including soil N patch size and CV at the 0.25 ha scale, and, at the 1 m(2) scale, a simple regression with soil conductivity CV and multiple regression including CV and patch size of soil N. Soil N was negatively associated with conductivity, likely due to sodium, the primary determinant of conductivity in this meadow steppe system, inhibiting plant growth and the capacity of soils to accumulate N. Consequently our results indicated that the heterogeneity of soil N was the principal control of plant species richness and H'. Moreover, our findings indicate that spatial structure (the average size of a patch), in addition to CV, was important in determining grassland species richness and diversity. Our results indicate that both components of environmental heterogeneity need to be included in future tests of the heterogeneity-diversity hypothesis."
"The relationship between biodiversity and ecosystem functioning (BEF) is a central topic in ecology on local, regional, and global scales. A powerful approach to BEF studies is large-scale field manipulative experimentation. The Inner Mongolian Grassland Removal Experiment (IMGRE) was designed to examine the mechanisms of the BEF relationship in the world's largest grassland, explicitly considering multiple trophic levels and grazing by grasshoppers and sheep. IMGRE followed a randomized block design, with a total of 512 plots (6 m x 6 m each). The project involved massive field campaigns and laboratory analyses, and unprecedentedly employed two removal protocols in parallel: complete removal (eradicating all targeted functional types) and partial removal (an equal-disturbance removal scheme). We summarize key findings on aboveground and belowground primary production, functional richness, identity, and composition, compensation at the species, PFT, and community levels, soil water and N retention, net N mineralization, microbial biomass, and grazing by grasshoppers and sheep. Comparing and contrasting results from the two removal protocols, we have found that the responses of ecosystem processes depend on plant functional richness and identity, as well as disturbance characteristics. As part of the special issue on the ecological patterns and processes in the Inner Mongolian Plateau, this article provides an overview of the IMGRE project. The findings of this project shed new light on the BEF relationship in natural grasslands, and have important implications for ecosystem management in the Mongolian Plateau."
"Spatial heterogeneity is ubiquitous in ecological systems, and has important effects on biological diversity and ecological processes. Does spatial heterogeneity affect the relationship between biodiversity and ecosystem functioning (BEF)? To help address this question, this study investigated how the spatial patterns of key BEF variables changed before and after the biodiversity removal during a BEF experiment in China. Our analysis was based on data from the Inner Mongolia grassland removal experiment (IMGRE) which was conducted in the Xilingol Steppe, Inner Mongolia, China. We quantified the spatial patterns of key variables of BEF, and examined the spatial relationships among these variables, using biodiversity indices and spatial statistical methods (autocorrelation and semivariance analysis). Our results show that the variables of BEF in the Inner Mongolian grassland had various spatial patterns, most of which were spatially correlated to each other. Removal treatments had significant effects on these spatial structures and correlations. These effects were diverse in terms of both their kinds and magnitudes because of different removal protocols and treatments. The differences in spatial patterns of plant and soil variables and their correlations before and after the biodiversity manipulation do not necessarily imply that the results from BEF experiments like IMGRE are invalid, but they do suggest that the possible effects of spatial heterogeneity on the BEF relationship should be further scrutinized in future studies."
"Although many studies have demonstrated that grazing may increase or decrease plant diversity of grasslands at small scales, few studies have examined the patterns and mechanisms of grazing effects on biodiversity across multiple scales. Our study tested the scale dependence of grazing effects on plant diversity based a 7-year grazing manipulation experiment with seven levels of grazing intensity (0-9 sheep ha(-1)) in a typical steppe of the Inner Mongolia grassland. Species area relationships (SARs) were used to analyze the scale dependence of species loss. SAR decomposition approaches were followed to examine the contribution of four potential mechanisms to changes in the slope of SARs, including species aggregation, overall species richness, total number of individuals, and species abundance distribution. The proportional species loss increased with sampling area (4-1024 m(2)), which was evidenced by decreasing intercepts and slopes of SARs with grazing. Reduction in the slope of SARs was mainly caused by changes in overall species richness and species abundance distribution, with the relative minor effect of changes in number of individuals. The negative effect of grazing on overall species richness was mainly attributed to the loss of grazing-sensitive rare species from species pool. Compared with flat systems, plant diversity in slope systems was more sensitive to grazing at low intensities. However, the responses of plant diversity to grazing tended to converge between the flat and slope systems at high levels of grazing intensity. Our study has important implications for adaptive ecosystem management and biodiversity conservation in arid and semiarid grasslands."
"Many studies have examined how intensity of grazing and patterns of precipitation individually and interactively influence the spatial and temporal dynamics of grassland vegetation, such as dominance, succession, coexistence, and spatial heterogeneity. However existing models have rarely considered the diet preferences of grazers and how they interact with variation in precipitation amount and timing. We examined how plant community structure responds to the individual and combined effects of grazing intensity, selective grazing, and patterns of precipitation, based on a six-year grazing experiment with seven levels of field-manipulated grazing intensity in a typical steppe of Inner Mongolia. The palatable species, mainly forbs, were most severely damaged at intermediate levels of grazing intensity; given that these species are the major contributors to plant community diversity, a U-shaped diversity-grazing intensity relationship resulted. In contrast, spatial heterogeneity of aboveground biomass and species composition peaked at intermediate levels of grazing intensity. Cold season precipitation positively correlated with the abundance of the dominant C-3 grasses and correlated negatively with the subdominant forbs and C-4 plants. Thus, when cold season precipitation increased, plant community species diversity decreased. Grazing intensity and precipitation did not interact in their effects on species richness. These findings contrast with the predictions from current disturbance-diversity models and indicate that diet selection of grazing animals is an important factor shaping the diversity-grazing intensity relationship in semi-arid grasslands. Future grassland biodiversity conservation and management practices should take diet preference of grazing animals into account."
"Disturbances may affect the spatial patterns of plant genetic diversity, but these effects are not yet well understood for lack of direct experimental evidence. Grazing is one of such environmental disturbance factors which may lead to small-scale spatial heterogeneity in natural grasslands. Our main goal was to determine whether a grazing disturbance alters population genetic diversity and genetic structure of the dominant species in the Inner Mongolia Steppe. We performed inter-simple sequence repeat (ISSR) molecular marker analysis on populations of Stipa grandis and S. krylovii which were exposed to five consecutive years of varying degrees of grazing disturbance. The amplification results showed that the genetic diversity of both S. grandis and S. krylovii populations varied under different grazing intensities; the highest diversity (Nei's index and Shannon's index) were under moderate disturbance, whereas the lowest under the heavy grazing. The coefficient of gene differentiation (G(ST)) of S. grandis and S. krylovii populations were 16.82 and 21.00 A degrees%, respectively. These results suggest that the genetic diversity of these two dominant populations was altered by the small-scale grazing disturbance, which provides new evidence supporting the theories of landscape genetics. The enhancement of moderate grazing on genetic diversity implies the necessity to involve animal grazing in the design of management regimes for biodiversity conservation of the Inner Mongolia steppes."
"Previous studies demonstrate that mowing inhibits tall species but facilitates short species and C-4 species. However, as each species has a growth-form and simultaneously a C-pathway, it is important to know whether the effects of mowing on a species is determined only or majorly by its growth-from or C-pathway. We test the hypothesis that mowing facilitates the growth of short species and of C-4 species, and disentangle the interactive effects of plant growth-forms and C-pathways on plant responses to mowing. We monitored plant production species by species in the grassland under mowing versus intact natural conditions over 30 years. We clustered all species into six plant growth-form groups and two C-pathways, and examined their dynamics. Mowing significantly (P < 0.05) increased short bunchgrasses (SG) and annual and biannual (AB) species and decreased tall grasses; mowing also significantly increased C-4 species (P < 0.01). However, as the C-4 species in the grassland are majorly SG and AB, and the mowing enhancement on C-4 SG and AB are respectively not greater than that on C-3 SG and AB, the C-4-pathway does not show a growth advantage under mowing, which suggests other plant traits such as phenology my also play an important role in plant response to mowing. Plant growth-forms instead of C-pathways play a dominant role in determining plant response to mowing disturbance in the grassland dominated by C-3-species. Our results provide new insights into the mechanisms of grassland succession, and have implications for management of the Inner Mongolia grassland."

"The new genus and species Bicoloromyces kyffinensis is described as new to science from a sterile crustose lichen, perhaps Lecanora fuscobrunnea or Lecidella sp. from Ebony Ridge of Mount Kyffin, Antarctica. The fungus recalls superficially the lichenicolous species referred to Taeniolella, but differs in having semi-macronematous conidiophores, tissues encrusted with calcium oxalate, aeruginose to blue-black colouration under the microscope, and conidia which are distoseptate and formed in basipetal chains. Energy dispersive spectroscopy established that the encrustations were of calcium oxalate. Differences from genera of rock-inhabiting fungi described from the Antarctic are discussed. This appears to be the furthest south any lichen-inhabiting fungus has been reported."
"The aim of this study was to clarify the trophic patterns of the key species Pleuragramma antarctica in the Dumont d'Urville Sea, through its development and possible changes according to sampling locations. Variability in diet composition of larvae, juvenile and adult P. antarctica was analysed using fatty acid markers. Analysis of lipid class in P. antarctica reflected lipid accumulation with increasing size at all sampling stations. The fatty acid composition of triacylglycerol highlighted ontogenetic changes in the diet. Phytoplankton markers, such as C16PUFA:C16 and EPA:DHA ratios >1, and carnivorous markers in larvae suggested an omnivorous diet. Comparison between the fatty acid signature of P. antarctica older stages (juveniles and adults) and zooplankton species using OPLS-discriminant analysis indicated that juveniles fed mainly on euphausiid larvae and to a minor extent on copepods, and confirmed that non-herbivorous copepods were the main prey for adults. Our results suggest that different feeding patterns and a generalist strategy in P. antarctica with juveniles feeding on bigger prey than adults, probably as a result of prey availability according to their vertical segregation pattern."
"Wright Valley, Victoria Land contains numerous aquatic habitats suitable for the growth of algae in summer. Excepting diatoms and lichen phycobionts, algal diversity and distribution in the valley was documented. Using cultures and environmental cloning eight cyanobacterial and 14 eukaryotic species were revealed. The cyanobacterium Microcoleus vaginatus and the chlorophycean Chlorococcum sp. 1 were the most common, both occurring in more than one habitat (ponds, soils or streams). Ponds harboured the most diverse communities. Habitat specialization was rare. Chlamydomonads were not found outside ponds, but species capable of zoospore production were able to colonize ponds and soils. Nostocalean cyanobacteria were not detected. Results suggest dispersal within and between valleys, with little evidence of Antarctic endemism. All but one cyanobacterium with similar internally transcribed spacer (ITS) length to clones from Miers Valley proved to be different species when 16S rRNA gene sequences were also considered; thus, ITS length is unreliable for assessing identity and biogeography of these cyanobacteria. Comparison with a 454 16S rRNA gene soil dataset from Wright Valley indicated the occurrence of only one of the cyanobacterial species, the distribution of which may be limited by salinity."
"The Adelie penguin (Pygoscelis adeliae) breeding population at Stranger Point, King George Island (25 de Mayo), increased in number from 1965/66 until 1980/81 after which it started to decrease almost continuously up to the present. A significant decrease in the number of breeding pairs and chicks creched was observed between 1995/96 and 2013/14 (75% and 78%, respectively), although the rate of this decrease has slowed since 2006/07. Over the last seven years, larger interannual fluctuations were recorded in the number of breeding pairs and chicks in creches, as well in the breeding success. The values for the index of breeding success during 2007/08, 2009/10 and 2012/13 were low and this parameter showed higher temporal fluctuation in the period 2007/08 to 2013/14. The reduction in breeding success and the number of chicks reared to creche will unfavourably impact on future population size at Stranger Point through the reduction of new recruits. Although Adelie penguin population trends on the Antarctic Peninsula are linked to the marine environment variability (i.e. reduction in sea ice affecting the availability of prey), breeding success is also influenced by the amount of snow fall which has increased in recent years."
"Comprehensive geochemical analyses (bulk parameters, major and trace elements, organic matter, mineralogy and particle analysis) were carried out on sediments from seven lakes on Fildes Peninsula, King George Island. The resulting compositional dataset was subjected to principal component analysis and cluster analysis. The results showed that four different lacustrine sedimentary environments can be distinguished: i) lakes 1 and 2 with relatively high values of secondary aluminous clay minerals, ii) lake 4 with anthropogenic enrichment of Co, Cu and Zn, iii) lake 7 with relatively high values of Ba and P and a high zeolite content, and iv) all the other studied lakes. Our results indicate moderate chemical weathering in all lacustrine sediments and that the distance to the glacial ice margin is one of the most important factors influencing the chemical weathering in the area. Furthermore, depositional processes have little influence on the geochemistry of the investigated elements and that local bedrock is the main source of sediments in the lakes on Fildes Peninsula."
"The WorldView-2 (WV2) instrument, operated by DigitalGlobe, is the only high-resolution multispectral sensor currently capable of imaging the entirety of the Transantarctic Mountains (TAM), making it a valuable resource for remote compositional investigations. Through the utility of both field-and laboratory-based verification techniques, this study shows that biotic and abiotic chemical variations can be readily observed and mapped remotely. Within the McMurdo Dry Valleys (MDV), primary compositional variability, intra-lithologic compositional heterogeneity and variations in surface weathering and oxidation can be successfully identified and mapped, providing confidence in both the spectral capabilities of the WV2 instrument and the methodologies associated with calibrating and correcting these data. These studies within the MDV provide confidence in extending these analyses to more remote regions of the TAM, including the vicinity of Shackleton Glacier. The identification of comparable geochemical variations in these remote locations provides valuable additions to the currently available geologic maps at much lower spatial resolutions. This work confirms the utility of the WV2 instrument to identifying, quantifying and mapping geochemical variations throughout the TAM, supporting future field work and providing geospatial context for localized field and laboratory analyses."
"Qualitative and quantitative analysis of surface species on size-segregated atmospheric particulate collected in Antarctica during the 2010-11 summer was performed by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). This represents the first example of surface characterization of Antarctic aerosols. The size class with particle cut-off diameter of 3 mu m was richest in terms of chemical elements. Peculiar findings of the application included detection of Ca (possibly surface-segregated) and surface enrichment of Mg. The determination of nitrate, ammonium and sulphate species on collection filters provides evidence for a possible advantage of XPS over more laborious techniques (e.g. ion chromatography). The presence of these species is in reasonable agreement with other recent reports from Antarctica."
"This study investigated the mass balance, melting, near-surface ice thermal structure and meteorological conditions of the Ecology and Sphinx glacier system (ESGS), located on King George Island, Antarctic Peninsula. The study also analysed the role of climate change in glacial retreat of the ESGS in the long (1979-2012) and short term, with a particular focus on the impact on the 2012-13 mass balance of the ESGS. In 2012-13, the glaciers had a mean annual net mass balance of +17.8 cm w.e., but over the long term the glaciers have been receding in this region. The area loss of the ESGS between 1979 and 2012 amounted to 41%. This investigation of mass balance is especially important as it offers one of only a few records available on King George Island. The mean near-surface ice temperature (February to June 2012) for the Ecology and Sphinx glaciers was -0.3 degrees C and -1.0 degrees C at 10m depth, respectively. From 1948-2012, the air temperature on King George Island increased by 1.2 degrees C (0.19 degrees C per decade)."
"Monitoring the rate of ice flow into ice shelves is vital to understanding how, where and when mass changes occur in Antarctica. Previous observations of ice surface velocity indicate that the Amery Ice Shelf and tributary glaciers have been relatively stable over the period 1968 to 1999. This study measured the displacement of features on the ice surface over a sequence of Landsat 7 images separated by approximately one year and spanning 2004 to 2012 using the surface feature tracking software IMCORR. The focus is on the region surrounding the southern grounding zone of the Amery Ice Shelf and its primary tributary glaciers: the Fisher, Lambert and Mellor glaciers. No significant changes in surface velocity were observed over this period. Accordingly, the velocity fields from each image pair between 2004 and 2012 were used to synthesize an average velocity dataset of the Amery Ice Shelf region and to compare it to previously published velocity datasets and in situ global positioning system velocity observations. No significant change in ice surface velocities was found between 2004 and 2012 in the Amery Ice Shelf region, which suggests that it continues to remain stable."
"Data on species distribution and management requirements are increasingly being used in urban landscape and conservation planning. Prairie crocus (Anemone patens L.) is a perennial herb whose populations have disappeared from the vicinity of most European cities. However, it can still be found within some urban areas in North America. This allows the study of the factors affecting urban populations of this species, which can be effectively utilized in land-use planning and habitat management. The aim of this research was to identify the type of management of native remnants of grasslands that would preserve A. patens populations within an urban and semi-urban landscape, as well as the relationship of this species to surrounding land use and human population. A total of 187 locations of A. patens were mapped along the urban-rural gradient within the city of Saskatoon and its vicinity in Saskatchewan, Canada. The degree of disturbance associated with management practices was recorded. Land use and human population was calculated within a 500 m radius of each location. These parameters were compared with the number of individuals of A. patens. It was revealed that urban populations of A. patens are positively correlated with grazing and burning. Proportion of urbanized land was negatively correlated with A. patens population size while natural habitat had a positive-effect. It is argued that preservation of sufficiently large natural remnants, appropriate management and restoration projects are necessary for the conservation of populations of A. patens in urban landscapes.

"This study examined the distribution of metals in residential soils from the scale of a residential yard to a metropolitan area by comparing residences along an urbanization gradient in the Baltimore Washington area, USA. In addition, earthworms and terrestrial isopods were sampled from residential yards to measure body burdens of metals. Soil metal concentrations from lawns and planting bed (road, foundation, and yard) patches were compared (1) among land-use types (inner urban, outer urban, suburban, and rural); (2) between pre- and post-1940 built residential structures; and (3) among yard patch types. Lawn soil concentrations of As, Cd, and Pb varied statistically among the land-use types. Differences between inner urban and rural lawn soils varied almost eight-fold for Pb, three-fold for Cd, and more than two-fold for As. Bed patches exhibited a slightly stronger relationship than lawns across the urbanization gradient. A similar relationship was shown for pre- and post-1940 structures with older having higher concentrations than post-1940 structures. Earthworm body burdens were statistically correlated with soil Pb, while isopod burdens exhibited a significant relationship with soil As, Cr, Ni, Pb, and Zn. A post-hoc analysis with bird blood Pb data that was available for the residences, showed a significant relationship with earthworm Pb body burdens. This study suggests that despite policy efforts to reduce metal emissions, contamination of soil persists in urban residences at levels that have health implications for people and wildlife living in the Baltimore Washington, DC area.

"It is important for planners and urban designers to understand how physical characteristics of urban streetscapes contribute to perceptions of them as safe, comfortable urban spaces. While urban design theory offers numerous suggestions for successful streetscapes there is meager empirical evidence of their effects. We suggest that this is largely due to precision and sample size limitations on audit-based physical design and human perception measurements. This paper overcomes these limitations by identifying a key set of ""streetscape skeleton"" design variables that can be efficiently measured using a GIS-based method. It then measures these variables on a large and diverse sample of streetscapes, and examines their relationship to crowdsourced perceived safety scores, a useful indicator of environmental comfort. Regression modeling indicates that factors related to streetscape enclosure have a substantial positive effect on perceived safety. These include street tree canopy, the number of buildings along a block, and the cross-sectional proportion the ratio of building height to width across the street between building facades. Importantly, these streetscape-scale skeleton variables have greater effect than neighborhood-scale urban form and affluence measures that are commonly used to identify desirable urban environments. Planning practitioners can draw on our results to set priorities for urban forestry and design guidelines that shape the spatial proportions of streetscapes and their success as spaces that feel safe and comfortable for human users.

"Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) are toxic organic pollutants produced from combustion. Associated with urban runoff, they have been detected worldwide in urban wetlands. Because PAHs and their associated metabolites are often carcinogenic, mutagenic, and teratogenic, they can pose significant risks to wetland-dependent organisms. We investigated the occurrence of 16 PAHs within water samples and tissues of damselflies (Odonata: Enallagma civile, a flagship group of predatory wetland insects) from seven urban wetlands (known regionally as playas) along a constructed stormwater gradient in Lubbock, Texas. PAH detections from water samples were highly variable across sites and dates, with naphthalene and pyrene occurring most often. PAH detections in adult damselflies were also variable but significantly different from corresponding water samples (suggesting bioaccumulation rather than passive chemical exposure), with naphthalene and fluoranthene occurring most often. The number of specific PAH detections was significantly associated with percent impervious surface within 300 m of a playa, but not with position along the stormwater gradient or number of drainage inflows. Therefore, for the urban playas and odonates of Lubbock, local factors were more important in determining PAH contamination than were landscape-level factors. PAH contamination can be reduced in future urban landscape planning and design by minimizing the amount of impervious surface around stormwater retention ponds, even if they are linked along a hydrologic gradient.

"Exposure to green space is associated with a variety of positive health states. Research to date has focused primarily on 'generic' green space in urban areas, where green space is relatively scarce and where it is dominated by playing fields and parks. The current research adds to our understanding with an examination of relationships between different types of green space and mental health in rural areas in England (approximate rural population = 4 million). The aggregate land cover classes of Land Cover Map 2007 were linked to rural residential areas (Lower-level Super Output Areas) and then linked to rural participants (n = 2020) in the 18-year longitudinal British Household Panel Survey. Random effects regression of mental health (as measured by GHQ12 scores) against land cover enabled effects to be simultaneously estimated from both mean between-individual differences and from within-individual differences over time. The nine natural land cover classes (Broadleaved woodland; Coniferous woodland; Arable; Improved grassland; Semi-natural grassland; Mountain, heath and bog; Saltwater; Freshwater; Coastal) were not significantly associated with differences in mental health between individuals. However, significant relationships were observed between some types of land cover and within-individual change in mental health amongst individuals who relocated during the 18 annual waves of the panel. These findings indicate the presence of important health related ecosystem services from different land cover types that have not previously been investigated and which help more effective spatial planning and land use management.

"Many urban areas lack in quality of urban condition, thus affecting the quality of life of urban dwellers. Great efforts are made to develop new strategies for transforming existing urban patterns toward higher quality, which is related to sodo-economic, environmental, transportation, and other factors. The analysis of possible transformations further requires considering their effects at a parcel scale up to the city region. This is important, because gaining in one quality at a local scale, e.g., housing supply, comes partly at the expense of other qualities, such as the availability of open space, affecting recreation amenities at a regional scale. However, an approach for the assessment of the urban condition's quality across multiple aspects and scales is not yet available. We demonstrate an indicator-based behavioral modeling approach, which illustrates interactions and effects on and between different spatial scales. An urban development scenario was compared to the status quo to show the effects on different quality aspects. A set of indicators was calculated from the modeling results and mapped for the regional, district, and local scale. The cross-scale analysis of the selected indicators effectively points to areas where densification patterns cause, e.g., loss in their recreational quality and, thus, potentially a degradation of the quality of life of urban dwellers. The presented approach helps understanding the relationships between political interventions, urban patterns, and their impact on urban quality. The spatially explicit visualization of possible effects may support matching different spatial development policy objectives across the divergent targets of regional planning participants.

"Knowledge of surface-atmosphere CO2 exchanges in urban forests is imperative. We measured net ecosystem CO2 exchange of an urban forest in Beijing over a two-year period (2012-2013). The aim was to examine seasonal controls of environmental variables on ecosystem carbon (C) cycle assessed with eddy covariance technique. Net ecosystem production (NEP) was 30% less in 2012 (200 +/- 27 g C m(-2)) than in 2013 (287 +/- 35 g C m(-2)). Both years were warmer than the long-term average. Seasonal and annual ratios of ecosystem respiration (ER) to gross primary productivity (GEP) were higher in 2012 than in 2013. Dry conditions decreased GEP more than ER, while warm conditions increased ER more than GEP. Heat stress exerted controls over seasonal changes in NEP. Daytime NEP ceased to increase beyond 11 mu mol CO2 m(-2) s(-1) and 13 mu mol CO2 m(-2) s(-1) in 2012 and 2013, respectively, where mean photosynthetically active radiation was >700 mu mol m(-2) s(-1) air temperatures was greatest (>27 degrees C) in mid-summer days. The extremely strong precipitation day (176 mm) was recorded as having the greatest C discharge to the atmosphere (5.6 g C m(-2)). Intermediate-size precipitation events (>2 mm and <= 15 mm) acted to increase C-sink strength. The results highlight the roles of environmental stresses and their alleviation in regulating C fixation in the face of warmer climate and increasing intensity of extreme precipitation events.

"Social acceptance for wind turbines is variable, providing a challenge to the implementation of this energy source. Psychological research could contribute to the science of climate change. Here we focus on the emotional responses to the visual impact of wind turbines on the landscape, a factor which dominates attitudes towards this technology. Participants in the laboratory viewed images of turbines and other constructions (churches, pylons and power-plants) against rural scenes, and provided psychophysiological and self-report measures of their emotional reactions. We hypothesised that the emotional response to wind turbines would be more negative and intense than to control objects, and that this difference would be accentuated for turbine opponents. As predicted, the psychophysiological response to turbines was stronger than the response to churches, but did not differ from that of other industrial constructions. In contrast with predictions, turbines were rated as less aversive and more calming compared with other industrial constructions, and equivalent to churches. Supporters and non-supporters did not differ significantly from each other. We discuss how a methodology using photo manipulations and emotional self-assessments can help estimate the emotional reaction to the visual impact on the landscape at the planning stage for new wind turbine applications.

"Technical advances in landscape visualization have tended to, and still do, outstrip the understanding of how best to use them in practical planning contexts. This paper draws upon recent literature and experience gained during a number of projects to address three key questions regarding the most effective use of 3D landscape visualizations for communication purposes. In essence these are ""when?"" (to use them), ""what?"" (to include) and ""how?"" (to display them). Three main visualization options (rendered still images, animations and real-time models) are compared and particular constraints and strengths are discussed. In addition, an evaluation is made of the ability of the information presented in landscape visualizations to meet criteria of credibility, salience and legitimacy when communicating with stakeholders. Closing guidance is given on the use of visualizations in landscape planning and suggestions regarding future research needs are made. These focus on the need for applications of 3D visualization techniques to be more systematically evaluated, ideally as part of landscape planning exercises where the benefits of particular approaches for different purposes and audiences are examined across all stages of the decision-making process.

"The central message of this essay is to make climate change more visible and meaningful to community members through landscape architectural techniques and building literacy. It identifies general principles for opening people's eyes to climate change, demonstrating the potentially powerful role that landscape can play in helping citizens to see and foresee climate change in their own backyards, where they care the most. In this context, the author emphasizes the value of local landscape & place-based experience, as well as the importance of designing visible solutions. The essay describes two linked frameworks that address respectively the possibility of seeing and recognizing climate change, and the need to consider not only climate change impacts but also its causes, mitigation and adaptation solutions. Landscape architects and landscape planners can play an integrative, educational & visionary role in creative design and engagement of communities on climate change. The essay offers four pathways for landscape professionals to integrate & enhance public engagement and literacy on climate change, through: applying landscape messaging to make climate change more visible on the ground; using compelling visual tools that reveal signs of climate change in local landscapes and depict resilient, low-carbon futures; local climate change visioning processes to help communities understand the implications for communities; and helping neighbours to self-educate and mobilize for local climate change action. Better training and a professionally endorsed code of ethics for visual media are needed to support this vital work. (C) 2015 Published by Elsevier B.V."
"Our wellbeing depends upon the services provided by ecosystems and their components. Despite recent advances in academic understanding of ecosystem services, and consideration in UK national environmental policy, a greater awareness is needed at community and individual levels. Dynamic features of virtual globe applications have considerable potential for helping convey the multi-dimensional context of ecosystem services and promoting general awareness. In a case study targeting residents in a small urban fringe river catchment in Norfolk, UK, representatives from local authorities and responsible agencies collaborated with scientists to produce extensive customisation of virtual globes in this context. By implementing a virtual flight over the catchment, different views and scales are traversed to set the context for landscape features and ecosystem services. Characteristic sites, e.g. supplying cultural services, are displayed and relationships with the natural environment are explained using linked on-screen text. Implementation is cost-effective and described for practitioners in ecosystem and landscape management, who may be inexperienced in landscape visualisation. Supplied as three pre-packaged virtual tours, products are made available for download and are publicised at a variety of engagement events, including teaching events with schoolchildren. The tours have attracted public interest and generated positive feedback about improving knowledge of local natural assets. Schoolchildren show confidence with the interface, but supplementary problem based activities can improve learning opportunities. The capacity of virtual globes to support more participatory involvement of the public in local ecosystem management may increase in the future, but such visualisations can already help promote community awareness of local landscape benefits.

"We are entering a period of rapid change in such landscape shaping forces as climate, the demand for food and water, fire, the push toward renewable energy, and the transition to GM-based agriculture. As a result the landscape, which has traditionally been a point of stability for many people, is likely to change significantly. Can the technologies we have to hand, and their increasing ubiquity, assist people to better understand the forces leading to landscape change, comprehend the science of landscape, take a more informed view on proposals, and adapt to some inevitable outcomes? This paper considers the potential, in this context, of smartphones and other devices that are equipped with positioning and orientation devices, significant computational power and high-speed communications. We all travel through the landscape; sometimes we fly over. During these movements the possibility exists to entertain, and educate, people with information about the landscape through, or over, which they are traveling, to give them insights into the changes that have occurred historically and may occur in the future, the processes at work and the choices that exist. There are several ways to do this including audio commentary and augmented reality displays using the device camera coupled with visualized alternative conditions. A prototype iPhone, called 'What's Here?' that includes augmented audio and visual features for landscape interpretation is described, and is illustrated with data related to climate change, renewable energy infrastructure, land use change and sea level rise. Associated data, technology and user issues are discussed. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved."

"This study presents a qualitative, comparative analysis of ex ante visualizations, created during planning and design phases, with ex post photography of landscape and architectural projects. Visualizations play an increasingly important role as decision-making tools in the planning process and are expected to successfully communicate proposals to both experts and laypersons. Outside of the wind farm industry there is a lack of detailed guidance for those creating landscape visualizations and currently no method of analyzing the accuracy of visualizations exists. In a world where we increasingly rely on information communicated in a visual manner it is imperative that potential viewers are provided with clues to enable them to distinguish between what is real and what is not. This study analyses a selection of visualizations from a cross section of landscape and architectural projects and reveals reoccurring patterns of inconsistencies in the depiction of content elements. The control of production through agreed guidelines proposed by previously published research could have both positive and negative effects for the future of visualization production. This research proposes that the starting point for honest communication lies in transparency, in both production techniques and presentation to clients, stakeholders and the public. There is scope for more in depth image analysis of a larger body of projects that may reveal more detailed findings that could contribute to future guideline discussions. (C) 2015 The Authors.

"This study synthesizes two evaluations of a local climate change planning process in a rural town in British Columbia (Canada), which was supported through landscape visualizations. First, the impact of the visualizations, based on scientific environmental modeling and presented in three different presentation formats, verbal/visual presentation, posters and a virtual globe, was evaluated with regard to immediate impacts during the process. Second, the long-term impacts on decision-making and actual outcomes were evaluated in a retrospective evaluation 22 months after the end of the initial planning process. Two results are highlighted: according to the quantitative pre-/post-questionnaires, the visualizations contributed to increased awareness and understanding. Most importantly, the retrospective evaluation indicated that the process informed policy, operational and built changes in Kimberley, in which the landscape visualizations played a role. The post interviews with key decision-makers showed that they remembered most of the visualizations and some decision-makers were further using them, particularly the posters. The virtual globe seemed to be not a ""sustainable"" display format suitable for formal decision-making processes such as council meetings though. That may change with the further mainstreaming of visualization technologies or mobile devices. Until then, we recommend using display formats that can be re-used following a specific planning event such as an Open House, to ensure on-going support for effective decision-making over the longer-term.

"Sophisticated geospatial modeling of environmental problems and hazards is far advanced in geography, decision science, and related fields. The political ecological application of these tools, especially in visualizing, debating, and contesting risk, is underdeveloped, however. By using visualizations of risk as an analytical tool to explore the views of citizens and county health officials, geospatial models can help to explore the schisms, connections, and associations among complex landscapes, diverse publics, and logics of governance. In this paper, we explore the case of West Nile virus in the Southwest United States, a site where county health departments, vector control districts, and urban residents practice varying methods of mosquito management. We created geospatial visualizations of mosquito microhabitat using a dynamic simulation model and remotely sensed imagery. These data, when differentially aggregated, produced divergent visualizations of mosquito risk spaces across the city of Tucson. Presenting maps to neighborhood residents and local health officials, we found they invited different understandings of spatialized areas of responsibility for mosquito management. Neighborhood focus groups expressed territorial notions of risk and responsibility that diverged widely from those of health officials. Visualizations were shown to both reflect and produce different mosquito narratives, showing how mapped models can help elicit political-ecological insight into the territorialization of mosquito control.

"This commentary considers three visualization studies that have implications for civic participation in design and planning of landscape change. Together, these studies suggest the inherent conflict posed by the verisimilitude of visualizations that are understood to be real or true. Their verisimilitude gives visualizations the capacity to engage stakeholders but also mislead or bias them, and this can promote or distort civic participation. I use the Principle of the Landscape as a Medium for Synthesis and the Principle of the Landscape as Method for Invention to discuss the implications of these studies for civic participation in landscape change, and for the use of visualization to advance landscape science and practice.

"Assessing information on aspects of identification, perception, emotion, and social interaction with respect to the environment is of particular importance to the fields of natural resource management. Our ability to visualize this type of information has rapidly improved with the proliferation of social media sites throughout the Internet in recent years. While many methods to extract information on human behavior from crowdsourced geodata already exist, this paper focuses on visualizing landscape perception for application to the fields of landscape and urban planning. Visualization of peoples' perceptual responses to landscape is demonstrated with crowdsourced photo geodata from Flickr, a popular photo sharing community. A basic, general method to map, visualize, and evaluate perception and perceptual values is proposed. The approach utilizes common tools for spatial knowledge discovery and builds on existing research, but is specifically designed for implementation within the context of landscape perception analysis and particularly suited as a base for further evaluation in multiple scenarios. To demonstrate the process in application, three novel types of visualizations are presented: the mapping of sightlines in Yosemite Valley, the assessment of landscape change in the area surrounding the High Line in Manhattan, and individual location analysis for Coit Tower in San Francisco. The results suggest that analyzing crowdsourced data may contribute to a more balanced assessment of the perceived landscape, which provides a basis for a better integration of public values into planning processes.

"In recent years, we have seen the emergence of sound mapping, through which users can share their recordings of sounds via online mapping platforms. These practices are enabled by an array of spatial and digital technologies that also facilitate the growth of the so-called volunteered geographic information (VGI) regarding contributions from users without training in conventional GIS or cartography. In the growing body of work on VGI, however, not much attention has been given to the emergence of such sound maps as part of the VGI constructions. Meanwhile, research in soundscape has not addressed the aspect of crowd-sourcing or user-generated contributions facilitated by new information and communication technologies. This article seeks to bridge this gap. It draws upon important insights from critical GIS research into investigating VGI as visual practices, while it is also informed by three areas of soundscape research including mapping soundscapes, tracing the production of soundscapes and exploring embodied experiences with soundscapes. Through an empirical case in China, this article suggests a two-level analytical framework: investigating in what ways crowd-sourced sound maps emerge and interpreting these sounds on their shared platforms. In so doing, this study calls for more engagement with the multi-modality aspect of visuality in mappings, which in turn may have implications for landscape design and planning. In this way, it seeks to enrich the discussion on critical visualization. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved."
"Big data is increasingly seen as a way of providing a more 'scientific' approach to the understanding and management of cities. But most geographic analyses of geotagged social media data have failed to mobilize a sufficiently complex understanding of socio-spatial relations. By combining the conceptual approach of relational socio-spatial theory with the methods of critical GIScience, this paper explores the spatial imaginaries and processes of segregation and mobility at play in the notion of the '9th Street Divide' in Louisville, Kentucky. Through a more context-sensitive analysis of this data, this paper argues against this popular spatial imaginary and the notion that the Louisville's West End is somehow separate and apart from the rest of the city. By analyzing the everyday activity spaces of different groups of Louisvillians through geotagged Twitter data, we instead argue for an understanding of these neighborhoods as fluid, porous and actively produced, rather than as rigid, static or fixed. Ultimately, this paper is meant to provide a conceptual and methodological framework for the analysis of social media data that is more attentive to the multiplicity of socio-spatial relations embodied in such data.

"Whether it is ""volunteered"" or not, user-generated content is the fastest-growing source of spatially referenced data as people around the world use various portals to comment on everyday life, share photos and sounds, and use location-aware devices to inform and influence everyday life. Planners and geographers are well-situated to employ such data in their efforts to broaden public participation in decision-making; understand people's perspectives of neighborhoods, monuments, natural areas, and infrastructure; and more deeply theorize new urban social relations emerging with the digital revolution. The three articles reviewed here engage with different on-line portals (Twitter, Flickr, and web-based collective sound maps), but encounter some similar methodological challenges for which they each develop novel solutions, thus indicating some important developments in the production of knowledge. At a more conceptual level, the articles each demonstrate the progress being made in theorizing new geographies of digital lives. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved."
"This article reviews the state of ""critical cartography"" which is being experimented with exuberance in a number of disciplines and arenas: geographers, community development activists, artists, and new media innovators, to name a few. The promise and possibilities of debunking and retooling cartography are significant: by opening up who can make a map and the kinds of maps that are made, overlooked phenomena can be reclaimed, different perspectives can be made apparent, and new knowledge constructed. However, the conditions under which the emancipatory potential of critical cartography might be realized need to be investigated. This article critiques the claims that current new mapping practices increase participation and democracy and outlines four issues critical cartography needs to further develop in order to increase its potential: 1) greater reflexivity on the critical cartographer's own position and influence of the project, 2) acknowledgement of the choices made of what not to include in the map, 3) greater consideration about the politics of aesthetics, 4) expanded search for deeper social engagement with new mapping projects. The article also discusses these issues through a case study map project of street vendors contesting the use of sidewalk space in Ho Chi Minh City. It explores the qualities a non-participatory, authored map project might engender critical visualization through processes of spatial ethnography. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved."
"In recent years, geospatial design (or geodesign) has emerged as an area of technological development, GIScience research, and design practice. With Esri leading the branding of this emerging area, geospatial technology developers, design consultancies, and academic units are recognizing the affordances of applying geovisualization and geoanalytical techniques to more conventional practices within design and planning fields. Additionally, the GISciences are being called to rearticulate their research agendas in the face of 'big data' and neogeography. This paper examines these developments with regard to criticality, or the ways in which mapping practices are applied in critical research - both research that seeks to situate the emergence of geospatial technologies and enrolls these technologies more directly as method. What is the criticality of mapping practices amid these developments? More specifically to the design and planning fields, how might geodesign align with critical GIS? I take up these questions by tracing three presuppositions of criticality in mapping while examining the conditions of geodesign's emergence: representation and futurity, neutrality and efficacy, and relationality and complexity. I conclude by outlining a research agenda for further advancement of a critical geodesign. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved."
"This paper pursues the research question how can asset mapping using mobile technology impact the discursive planning environment affecting a cultural landscape? This paper examines this through the review of a case study entitled Cellphone Diaries. It features the work of African American community residents who participated in asset mapping using smartphones and created self-authored digital videos recording their memories of people, places, and events occurring in John Chavis Memorial Park. The park, located one mile southeast of the center of Raleigh, North Carolina and situated in the heart of Raleigh's largest historically African American community. The park was undergoing significant changes that the community interpreted as the loss of significant cultural landscape features. Through Cellphone Diaries, community residents created videos that were examined using discourse analysis, linked to an online map, and disseminated as a catalog of community perceptions of the meaning of the park. The location of their narratives on spatial maps produced a geographically referenced interpretive tool highlighting previously undocumented people, places, and events important to the community. The paper argues that the use of mobile technology constitutes a critical visualization approach that affected the park planning discourse by enabling community people to create material products (videos and maps) that positioned their narratives in multiple discourses beyond the immediate planning context. The larger influence of these expanded positions, including through media and arts community outlets, increased the power of their narratives to affect change in the park planning process.

"In this commentary, I explore the notion of criticality presented in the three articles in this section of the special issue.

"Plant-herbivore interactions occur in all ecosystems and provide a major avenue for energy flow to higher trophic levels. A long-standing hypothesis to explain the latitudinal gradient in species diversity proposes that the relatively stable and frost-free climate of the tropics should lead to more intense biotic interactions in tropical compared with temperate environments, giving rise to a greater diversity of plants and herbivores. Herbivory rates have been compared across latitudes to test this biotic interactions hypothesis, with herbivory typically being measured from observable leaf damage. However, we argue that a measure of percentage leaf damage alone does not straightforwardly reflect the cost of herbivory to the plant, and on its own does not constitute an appropriate test of the biotic interactions hypothesis. For a given amount of herbivory, the impact of herbivory is dependent upon many factors, such as the construction cost of the leaf, the growth and replacement rates and leaf life span. We investigate the latitudinal gradient in herbivory by analysing a large dataset of herbivory rates for 452 tree species and separating the species into those with short and long leaf life spans. We show that annual herbivory rates tend to be greater at lower latitudes for evergreen species (which have long-lived leaves), but no trend in herbivory rate with latitude was found for species with short leaf life spans. Phylogenetic least squares regression assuming Ornstein-Uhlenbeck processes also showed a negative effect of latitude on herbivory rate for evergreen trees, but we caution that viewing herbivory as a species trait is problematic. An integrative approach that incorporates leaf life span, as well as the costs of investment in growth and potential costs of losing leaf tissue, is needed to further our understanding of the ecological and evolutionary dynamics of herbivory."
"Aim Early in their evolution, angiosperms evolved a diversity of leaf form far greater than that of any other group of land plants. Some of this diversity evolved in response to varying climate. Our aim is to test the global relationship between leaf form in woody dicot angiosperms and the climate in which they live. Location We have compiled a data set describing leaf form(using 31 standardized categorical characters) from 378 natural or naturalized vegetation sites from around the world. Our data include sites from all continents except Antarctica and encompass biomes from tropical to taiga, over a range of elevations from 0.5 m to over 3000 m. Methods We chose the Climate Leaf Analysis Multivariate Program sampling, scoring and analytical protocols to test the relationships between climate and leaf form, which is based on canonical correspondence analysis. Cluster analysis evaluates the role of historical factors in shaping the patterns, and pairwise Pearson correlations examine the relationships among leaf characters. Results Woody dicot leaf characters form a physiognomic spectrum that reflects local climate conditions. On a global scale, correlations between leaf form and climate are consistent, irrespective of climate regime, vegetation type or biogeographic history. Relationships with temperature variables are maintained even when leaf margin characters, regarded as being particularly well correlated with mean annual temperature, are removed. Main conclusions In natural woody dicot vegetation an integrated spectrum of leaf form has developed across multiple leaf character states and species. This spectrum appears more strongly influenced by prevailing climate than biogeographic history. The covariation of leaf traits across species suggests strong integration of leaf form. New methods of exploring structure in multidimensional physiognomic space enable better application of leaf form to palaeoclimate reconstruction."
"Aim Latitudinal patterns in biotic interactions, particularly in herbivory, have been widely debated. We conducted a quantitative research synthesis to test whether background losses of woody plant foliage to insects generally decrease from the equator to the poles, and whether geographical gradients in insect herbivory are stronger at higher latitudes than at lower latitudes. Location Global terrestrial ecosystems. Methods We used published and original data (3482 point estimates of the percentage of leaf area consumed by insects, collected from 941 species of woody plants in 836 localities world-wide) to analyse the geographical patterns in total losses of plant foliage and in losses to defoliating, leaf mining and leaf galling insects separately, and we searched for climatic factors that can explain the variation in the levels of background insect herbivory across the globe and within climate zones. Result On average, according to published data woody plants lose 7.55% of their leaf area to insects, but 4.73% according to our original data collected in a blinded way. These losses demonstrate a dome-shaped latitudinal pattern: they peak in temperate zones, slightly decrease towards the equator and strongly decrease towards the poles. This pattern is consistent between published and original data, indicating the robustness of the detected relationship between herbivory and latitude. The climatic factors explaining these latitudinal patterns in insect herbivory differ between climate zones. Main conclusions Our study provides solid support for the hypothesis of a decrease in background herbivory with latitude, but only outside the tropics. For the first time we demonstrate that the latitudinal gradient in insect herbivory across the globe is nonlinear, i.e. its slope differs between the climate zones. In temperate and polar zones, but not in the tropics, background herbivory correlates with mean air temperatures and is therefore likely to increase with climate warming."
"Aim Using conifers as a model system, we aim to test four hypotheses. H1: the processes that shape the phylogenetic structure of regional species assemblages depend on climate. H2: apparent effects of current climate can be equally well explained by past climate. H3: strong Quaternary climate oscillations have led to phylogenetically non-random assemblages, either with few closely related species because isolated populations do not persist long enough to become new species or with many close relatives due to increased allopatric speciation. H4: strong late Cenozoic aridification has led to assemblages with many close relatives due to extinction and adaptive radiation. Location Global. Methods We used boosted regression trees to relate the net relatedness index (NRI) of regional conifer assemblages to current climate, past climate (0.021, 3 and 7.3-11.6 Ma), and gradual and cyclic late Cenozoic climate change while simultaneously accounting for habitat and biogeographic covariates. Results Climate was the most important predictor of NRI, supporting H1. Current and past climate showed similar relationships with NRI, supporting H2. Conifer NRI was further related to Quaternary climate oscillations and gradual late Cenozoic climate trends, but the shape of the relationships supported neither H3 nor H4. Main conclusions The climate-NRI relationships suggest that late Cenozoic climate consistently influenced the dynamics of conifer speciation, extinction and dispersal, leading to global patterns of phylogenetic assemblage structure. We deduce from the phylogenetic structure that diversification has been highest in warm or dry climates over the last >= 11.6 Myr. The fact that phylogenetic structure is related to climate trends and oscillations indicates that climate change plays an important role in addition to climate per se, but the exact underlying mechanisms remain unclear. Our results suggest that past climate needs to be taken into account when aiming to explain the phylogenetic structure of regional assemblages and other related aspects of biodiversity."
"Aim To evaluate the existence of a latitudinal gradient of richness (LGR) in rocky intertidal gastropods and the role of evolutionary processes in shaping the LGR. Location The entire eastern Pacific coast, from Alaska to Tierra del Fuego, encompassing ca. 120 degrees latitude. Methods The LGR was assessed using field surveys and a comprehensive literature dataset from 308 rocky intertidal sites, representing 328 species and 159 genera. The importance of geographic patterns of diversification in shaping the LGR was assessed using three complementary approaches. First, we used the fossil record to evaluate the region of origination of genera (tropical vs. extra-tropical). Secondly, we used a nestedness analysis to compare present-day biogeographic distributions of genera with their region of origin. Finally, we evaluated the importance of biogeographic dynamics for shaping the LGR using a projection matrix and estimating transition probabilities among different biogeographic states. Results Eastern Pacific rocky intertidal gastropods follow the canonical latitudinal gradient of richness (higher richness in the tropics). Originations were similar in the tropics and extra-tropics, a pattern that was robust to geographic differences in fossil sampling. The biogeographic distribution of genera was significantly nested, irrespective of the region of origin of genera. The distribution dynamics model accurately reproduced the LGR and showed that key-transitions are low extinction in the tropics and high dispersal of taxa from the extra-tropics to the tropics. Conclusions The existence of a canonical LGR in rocky intertidal gastropods can be explained by the combined effect of reduced extinction rates in the tropics and the range expansion of taxa from the extra-tropics toward the tropics, in what we have called the 'into the tropical museum' hypothesis."
"Aim Determining which species are more prone to extinction is vital for conserving Earth's biodiversity and for providing insight into macroevolutionary processes. This paper utilizes the Pliocene to Recent fossil record of mollusks to identify determinants of species' extinction over the past three million years of Earth history. Location Western Atlantic. Methods We focus on 92 bivalve and gastropod species that lived during the mid-Pliocene Warm Period (mPWP; similar to 3.264-3.025 Ma) and have either since gone extinct or are still extant. We used ecological niche modeling (ENM) to assess the vulnerability of these species to extinction as a function of both fundamental (FN) and realized ( RN) niche breadth proxies, geographic range size, and amount of suitable area available to them during the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM; similar to 21 Ka). Results Geographic range size emerged as a key predictor of extinction for the studied mollusk species, with RN breadth and amount of suitable area available during the LGM as secondary predictors. By contrast, FN breadth was not a significant predictor of extinction risk. Main conclusions The failure to recover FN breadth as a predictor of extinction may suggest that extinction resistance is achieved when species are more successful in filling the geographic extent of their fundamental tolerances. That is, when it comes to species' survival, being a generalist or specialist sensu stricto may be secondary to the unique historical, dispersal, and biotic constraints that dictate a species' occupation of suitable environments, and consequently of geographic space, at a particular time. Identifying the factors that promote extinction is important because of the time-intensive nature of estimating extinction risk for individual species and populations, and because of the rising concerns about the future of marine ecosystems and biodiversity."
"Aim Variation in species composition among sites (beta-diversity) generally decreases with increasing latitude, but the underlying mechanisms are ambiguous. Although both local and large-scale processes may drive this pattern, they act all through influencing species abundance distribution (SAD) and spatial pattern of species. A null model incorporating SAD is often used to calculate expected beta-diversity, which accounts for most variation in beta-diversity. However, a recent study has shown that the deviation of observed beta-diversity from expected values (beta-deviation) increases with latitude. The latitudinal gradients in beta-deviation may be related to both latitudinal differences in SADs and the degrees of spatial aggregation. Our study aims to (1) investigate how beta-deviation varies with SAD and spatial aggregation, and (2) separate the contributions of SAD and aggregation in explaining latitudinal gradients in beta-deviation. Location Global. Methods 197 forest plots (each containing 10 subplots) distributed along latitudinal gradients were used. Two beta-diversity models were derived for communities with randomly and nonrandomly distributed species. The two models were used to simulate relationships of beta-deviation with SAD and aggregation, and to separate the contributions of these two factors in explaining latitudinal gradients in beta-deviation. Results beta-deviation increased with the degree of aggregation and peaked at intermediate species abundance. The fraction of beta-deviation linked to SAD increased with latitude in global and regional analyses, whereas the fraction of beta-deviation linked to aggregation was only significantly correlated with latitude in New World south. The degree of aggregation increased with latitude in New World south, but not in global extent and New World north. Main conclusions The latitudinal gradients in beta-deviation are primarily explained by latitudinal differences in SADs. Additionally, the expected beta-diversity is determined solely by SAD. Therefore, we conclude that latitude-beta-diversity gradients at local spatial scales appear to be explained by latitudinal differences in SADs."
"Aim To evaluate the relative importance of environmental factors relevant to specific hypotheses that have been proposed to explain the distribution of social and subsocial Anelosimus spiders in the American continent and Ecuador. For social species, we test the seasonality and prey size hypotheses, which posit that species forming long-lived multifemale colonies require aseasonal conditions and warm and productive environments in which large insects can develop. For subsocial species, we test the rain intensity and predation risk hypotheses, which posit that species whose colonies contain a single female and her offspring cannot occupy areas where strong rains cause frequent damage to their webs and where warm temperatures and high productivity promote greater predation. Location America, Ecuador. Methods Using generalized linear models, hierarchical variance partitioning, Maxent distribution modelling and phylogenetically controlled regressions, we analysed the relative importance of environmental variables that either directly or indirectly relate to these non-exclusive hypotheses - temperature and precipitation seasonality (seasonality hypothesis), annual temperature and net primary productivity (insect size and predation hypotheses) and rain intensity (rain intensity hypothesis). Results Temperature seasonality, followed by annual temperature and rain intensity, were the most important predictors of the distribution of spider sociality across America, whereas temperature and rain intensity predominated in the largely aseasonal Ecuador. In general, social species were associated with lower temperature seasonality, warmer temperatures and higher rain intensity than subsocial species. Main conclusion The association of social Anelosimus with warm and wet areas in the tropics is consistent with both the seasonality and prey size hypotheses, i.e. both aseasonal conditions and warm temperatures, which allow large insects to develop, are needed for large social colonies to form. That subsocial Anelosimus drop-out from tropical areas with warm temperatures and high rain intensity is consistent with the hypotheses that high predation risk and disturbance by strong rains exclude subsocial Anelosimus from the lowland rain forest."
"Aim Spatial models of the impacts of climate change generally assume that species are restricted to their realized niche, and will persist only if that niche remains accessible through time. However, species often have physiological limits beyond the range of environmental conditions experienced in their present realized niche, and these limits may also be extended further through evolution in response to the selection pressure provided by climate change. Our aim was to develop a general framework for incorporating key parameters relating to physiological limits and adaptive evolution into models of the impact of climate change. Location Global. Methods Four types of parameter are defined in our framework: the realized limit, the current physiological limit, the evolutionary physiological limit and the rate of adaptive evolution. These parameters can be estimated or predicted using a variety of information sources, and can be applied to a diverse range of modelling approaches. Results We illustrate the utility of this approach by describing how parameters can be measured directly for model species, and by exploring how minimal information on phylogeny and distribution might enable parameter estimation for less well-studied species. We outline a general strategy for deriving these parameters from ongoing research, involving a cascading hierarchy of information ranging from direct observations of traits closely linked to the parameters of interest (e.g. from physiological or evolutionary experimentation) through to more distal indicators (e.g. ecological traits such as niche position or range size). Main conclusions The incorporation of adaptive capacity into spatial modelling of biological responses to climate change is now eminently achievable. Significant sources of data are available that can be used as predictors or indicators of physiological limits and the capacity for adaptive evolution innon-model organisms. These data offer a common currency for addressing one of the most important limitations of current efforts to model the impacts of climate change on biological distributions."
"The modern bioregionalization revival is marked by an abundance of revised biogeographical classifications along with new analyses at both local and global scales. Many of these new regionalizations are based on sophisticated geospatial and species distributional models whereas others focus on the information about area relationships as inferred from the phylogenetic relationships of taxa in the areas. This results in a dichotomy between geospatial and phylogenetic approaches: areas may have the same name, but different composition and relationships. We see an opportunity to move bioregionalizations forward by proposing new regions or revising well-known regions to reflect the advances that have been made in our understanding of phylogeny, biodiversity and Earth history during the past 50 years. Twenty-first century biogeographers can adopt the methods of phylogenetic systematics which prescribe how taxa and their characters may be used to infer hierarchical relationships. In an analogous way, natural bioregions may be discovered by treating biotic areas as taxa and finding aggregate patterns of distributional relationships - a general areagram - as specified by phylogenies of the clades that live in those areas. We demonstrate the differences in these two approaches - general areagrams versus distributional models - in bioregionalizations and definitions of the Australian and the Neotropical regions."
"AimGondwanan vicariance, boreotropical migration and long-distance dispersal have been posited as alternative hypotheses explaining the tropical distribution patterns and diversifications in many fern groups. Here, the historical biogeography of Diplazium is reconstructed to evaluate the impact of these biogeographical processes in shaping the modern tropical disjunctions. LocationWorld-wide with a focus on tropical forest habitats. MethodsDivergence times were estimated by analysing nucleotide sequences of seven plastid DNA regions (atpA, atpB, matK, rbcL, rps4, rps4-trnS and trnL-F) from 123 species of Diplazium and its allied genera, using a Bayesian relaxed clock method and three fossil calibrations. The ancestral areas were reconstructed using the likelihood dispersal-extinction-cladogenesis (DEC) approach. ResultsThe crown group of Diplazium was estimated to have originated in Eurasia and undergone an initial diversification in the Northern Hemisphere around 41.7Ma [95% highest posterior density (HPD): 34-49Ma] during the Eocene. Two disjunct events between the Old and New World were identified: one in subgenus Diplazium around the Eocene-Oligocene boundary (31.2Ma, 95% HPD: 25-38Ma), and the other in subgenus Callipteris during the middle Miocene (12.6Ma, 95% HPD: 15-23Ma). Furthermore, Palaeotropical disjunctions in subgenus Callipteris are indicative of multiple dispersal events during the Miocene. Main conclusionsThe evolutionary history of Diplazium involves a variety of biogeographical scenarios. Early diversification of Diplazium in the Northern Hemisphere during the Eocene corresponds with the migration from Eurasia to North America over land bridges as a member of the boreotropical flora. The current tropical amphi-Pacific disjunctions in subgenus Diplazium can be better explained by the disruption of boreotropical belt, however, long-distance dispersal between Eurasia and tropical America cannot be ruled out. Island-hopping and trans-Pacific dispersals followed by speciation characterize the disjunctions and diversifications of subgenus Callipteris during the Neogene. Gondwanan vicariance is not supported by any of our results."
"AimWe set out to explain the bipolar distribution of Carex maritima, clarifying the direction and timing of dispersal. We also tested mountain-hopping and direct long-distance dispersal hypotheses, as well as the relationship of C. maritima with biotic and abiotic factors that could explain the bipolar distribution. LocationArctic/boreal latitudes of both hemispheres. MethodsMolecular and bioclimatic data were obtained for C. maritima and related species from section Foetidae. We sequenced two (rps16 and 5trnK intron) plastid DNA regions (cpDNA) and the external and internal transcribed spacers (ETS and ITS) of the nuclear ribosomal gene region (nrDNA) and inferred phylogenetic relationships, divergence time estimates and biogeographical patterns using maximum likelihood, statistical parsimony, Bayesian inference and ecological niche modelling. ResultsCarex maritima populations from the Southern Hemisphere were genetically and ecologically differentiated from their northern counterparts and formed a monophyletic group nested within a paraphyletic C. maritima. Divergence time analysis estimated a middle-late Pleistocene divergence of the southern lineage (0.23Ma; 95% highest posterior density: 0.03-0.51Ma). Southern Hemisphere populations are more stenotopic than the Northern Hemisphere ones, which tolerate harsher conditions. Main conclusionsOur results point to a middle-late Pleistocene migration of C. maritima by long-distance dispersal, either directly or via mountain-hopping, from the Northern Hemisphere to the Southern Hemisphere."
"AimWe compared the genetic variability and phylogeographical structure of three sympatric clades of annual killifishes (the Nothobranchius furzeri complex, N.orthonotus complex and N.rachovii complex) inhabiting annually desiccating savanna pools. Hypotheses on the mechanisms affecting intraspecific structure and speciation were tested. LocationTemporary pools in Mozambique (Africa). MethodsThe study is based on spatially detailed samples covering the entire range of all three species complexes. A set of 12-13 microsatellites (1638 individuals, 96 populations) and cytochrome b sequences (463 fish, 152 populations) were used as genetic markers. Phylogenetic and population genetic approaches were used to describe the spatial genetic structure and to test the respective roles of river channels and river basins on diversification. ResultsProfound genetic differentiation among populations was evident; some populations located only a few kilometres apart were genetically very distinct, suggesting a significant role of genetic drift and low dispersal ability. Large rivers (Zambezi, Save, Limpopo) formed major barriers to gene flow, with minor differences among the three complexes. Further, the demographic expansion of previously isolated lineages was often limited by the river channel, and rivers were also confirmed as factors affecting speciation events. River basins and elevational gradient had a smaller, but non-negligible, role in population structuring. Main conclusionsRiver channels are the main barriers to gene flow in Nothobranchius fishes. The study demonstrated low dispersal ability and congruence in the phylogeographical pattern of all three complexes. Cases where Nothobranchius appear to have crossed river channels result from the dynamics of river morphology rather than from rare dispersal events. This conclusion is supported by simultaneous crossing events across lineages. A further division, also consistent among the three complexes, was detected between drier inland and wetter coastal areas. The phylogeographical pattern of Nothobranchius is unique in that it combines features of both aquatic and terrestrial taxa."
"AimWe infer the evolutionary history of the land snail genus Allognathus from a molecular phylogeny. An approximate temporal framework for its colonization of the Balearic Islands and diversification within the archipelago is provided according to palaeogeographical events in the western Mediterranean Basin. LocationThe Balearic Islands, Western Mediterranean. MethodsA 2461-bp DNA sequence dataset was generated from one nuclear and two mitochondrial gene fragments in 87 specimens, covering all nominal taxa of the genus Allognathus. Through maximum-likelihood and Bayesian phylogenetic methods along with a Bayesian molecular clock, we examined the evolutionary history of the group. Ancestral distribution ranges were estimated for divergence events across the tree using a Bayesian approach. We also used genetic species-delimitation models to determine the taxonomy of Allognathus. ResultsWe provided the first molecular phylogeny of Allognathus, a genus endemic to the Balearic Islands. The origin of the genus in the Balearic Islands was dated to the middle Miocene based on palaeogeographical events in the Western Mediterranean. During the late Miocene and Pliocene, several diversification events occurred within the archipelago. The ancestral range of Allognathus was reconstructed as the north-eastern Tramuntana Mountains of Mallorca. Main conclusionsThree species were delimited within the genus, one of which has at least five subspecies. The phylogenetic reconstruction showed a high degree of parallelism between the divergence of the main Allognathus lineages and the palaeogeography of the Balearic Islands. The genus appears to have colonized Mallorca from the south-east of the Iberian Peninsula during the middle Miocene. Sea level fluctuations that took place in the Western Mediterranean from the Messinian to the present are consistent with the diversification and secondary contacts of the phylogroups of Allognathus, as well as their distribution ranges. The middle Miocene could have been a period for the colonization of the Balearic Islands by other terrestrial organisms."
"AimUnderstanding the reasons why hosts lose, maintain or swap their parasite burden after colonizing new areas has long intrigued island biogeographers. Using molecular markers, we evaluated parasite biogeography of a multiple parasite system of Apicomplexa protozoans (haemosporidian and coccidian parasites) showing different modes of transmission in the spectacled warbler (Sylvia conspicillata), a small passerine with recently founded populations in Macaronesia. LocationTwelve oceanic islands of three Macaronesian archipelagos (Madeira, the Canary Islands and Cape Verde) and two continental areas (the Iberian Peninsula and Morocco). MethodsWe amplified and sequenced fragments of the parasite mitochondrial genome (cytochrome b for haemosporidian and cytochrome c oxidase subunit I for coccidian parasites) to determine the prevalence, richness, diversity and associations between groups of pathogens from the continental sources to the Macaronesian islands. We also built a haplotype network for the coccidian parasites to obtain insights on their evolutionary history. ResultsWe did not find a significant reduction in parasite diversity in the Macaronesian islands compared with the mainland. The prevalence was higher in Macaronesia for both parasite groups than on the mainland, although it was only significant for the haemosporidian parasites. The haplotype network revealed an unexpectedly strong differentiation in the coccidia, with a similar structure to the haplotype topology previously found in the host. Main conclusionsOceanic islands provide model systems for disentangling geographical origins, colonization pathways, and diversification of avian hosts through analysis of parasites. We show that analysis of coccidians, which closely track the evolutionary history of their avian hosts, may illuminate co-speciation processes in both groups. Our results show that coccidian populations in Macaronesia are highly structured but fail to provide support for the predicted impoverishment of parasite assemblages on islands."
"AimThe aim of this study was to understand whether the large-scale biogeographical patterns of the species-area, species-island age and species-isolation relationships associated with marine shallow-water groups in the Atlantic Ocean vary among marine taxa and differ from the biogeographical patterns observed in terrestrial habitats. LocationAtlantic Ocean. MethodsReef fish, gastropod and seaweed species richness as well as reef fish endemic species data were obtained for 11 Atlantic oceanic islands. Using a multimodel inference approach based on linear and nonlinear regressions, we tested hypotheses regarding the variation in species richness and endemism as a function of island area, age and isolation. Best models were selected using ratios between Akaike weights corrected for small sample size (AIC(c)). Results were compared between the three shallow-water species groups and contrasted against previous studies of marine and terrestrial systems. ResultsIsland area was the best single predictor of gastropod and seaweed richness, although it was not an improvement compared to the null model for reef fish. Island age explained richness in all taxa and was the best single predictor of reef fish richness. Isolation was a good predictor of seaweed richness but not of fish and gastropod richness, possibly because of their overall higher dispersal capacity. Reef fish endemism was influenced solely by island isolation. Main conclusionsThis work reveals large-scale island biogeographical patterns for marine shallow-water organisms in the Atlantic Ocean. Our results suggest that reduced gene flow is a potentially important mechanism for the maintenance of reef fish endemism in oceanic islands. The role of island age regarding the species richness of all taxa emphasizes the importance of habitat history for the geographical distribution of marine shallow-water biodiversity. Finally, we show that some island biogeographical patterns differ not only between marine and terrestrial ecosystems but also, importantly, within marine shallow-water environments, where the biogeographical patterns are highly taxon-dependent."
"AimRange disjunctions are frequent in birds, but the relative roles of vicariance and long-distance dispersal in producing them are debated. Odontophorid quail are widespread in tropical and temperate habitats in the Americas, yet recent phylogenetic studies support the view that they are sister to sub-Saharan African Ptilopachus rather than the widespread Phasianidae as formerly believed. To understand how this 10,000km range disjunction arose in relatively non-vagile birds, we reconstructed colonization history and diversification of odontophorids with respect to hypothesized dry-land connections between continents (North Atlantic, Beringian, Panamanian) that would have facilitated faunal exchange. LocationAfrica, Nearctic and Neotropics. MethodsWe inferred a fossil-calibrated odontophorid phylogeny from DNA sequences (three mitochondrial genes and eight nuclear introns) and modelled ancestral ranges with six probabilistic biogeographical models. We used the Akaike information criterion (AIC) to select the best-fit biogeographical model. ResultsPtilopachus and New World quail shared an Old World ancestor c. 32Ma. During this period, Beringia connected the Nearctic and Palaearctic, and global temperatures were high, such that presence of temperate organisms at high latitudes and direct dispersal across land connections were feasible. The extant New World quail began diversifying in Central America c. 18Ma; timing estimates and ancestral range reconstructions support the hypothesis that New World quail colonized and diversified in South America following closure of the Isthmus of Panama. Main conclusionsThe Africa/New World range disjunction between New World quail and Ptilopachus is the result of changes in Earth and climate history, combined with range expansion and diversification in the New World, and range contraction in the Old World. We find no evidence for overwater dispersal in New World quail."
"AimThe ecological niche of a species is dynamic at a variety of spatial and temporal scales; embracing this complexity is required for accurate assessment of species' niche requirements and to forecast how species will respond to novel and dynamic climates. In the context of recent advances in species distribution modelling, however, both the environment and the ecological niche of a species have often been treated and quantified as static entities. Here, our aim was to explore how species' realized niches and geographical ranges are dynamically shaped by the decoupled spatio-temporal availability of different environmental conditions, using the migration of Sylvia warblers as an example. LocationPalaearctic, Afrotropical and Indo-Malay ecozones. MethodsWe used a species distribution modelling approach to evaluate the niche characteristics of Sylvia warblers under their actual migration strategies as well as null models assuming resident behaviour. We focused on climate and land cover as niche dimensions, taking into account the spatial availability of environmental conditions during the peak breeding and non-breeding season for each Sylvia species. ResultsMigration did not increase the overlap between breeding and non-breeding niches compared with breeding and non-breeding niche overlap in resident null models. Sylvia warblers did not compensate for the costs of a longer migratory journey by tracking their climatic niche or land-cover niche more closely. Instead, Sylvia warblers migrated further than the closest available area with suitable climate and land cover. Main conclusionsClimatic niche tracking is unlikely to be the main driver of migration in Sylvia warblers. We suggest that taking dynamic environments into account and comparing actual niche characteristics to those resulting from alternative possible range dynamics enhances our understanding of the drivers behind organisms' movements and distributions."
"AimThe biogeography of seamount fauna remains poorly known, with less than 1% of the world's seamounts having been investigated. Here, we report data on the geographical isolation of species in the octocoral genus Chrysogorgia from south-west Pacific seamounts and slopes, and contrast the results with patterns observed in the north-western Atlantic. LocationSeamounts of the Norfolk Ridge (NR) and Loyalty Ridge (LR), the slope of New Caledonia, and the Matthew and Hunter Islands, south-west Pacific Ocean, with comparative material from the Pacific and Atlantic oceans. MethodsThe mitochondrial gene mtMutS was used to measure diversity within Chrysogorgia. Community structure was analysed using rarefaction, multivariate analyses, parsimony analysis of endemicity and analysis of molecular variance. The impact of underestimating species richness when using mitochondrial haplotypes was tested using simulations. ResultsSix hundred and thirty-four colonies and 31 haplotypes were sampled from New Caledonia. Contrary to what was observed in the north-western Atlantic, seamount-scale endemism of south-west Pacific Chrysogorgia was substantial (23% and 39% for haplotypes with n20 and n2, respectively). LR sheltered 64% of the New Caledonian haplotype diversity. Assemblages were structured less by habitat type (slope versus seamounts) than by depth. Rarefaction analyses suggested that LR and NR seamounts hold more species than the New Caledonian slope, but additional sampling in the south-western Pacific (133 colonies) revealed that some seemingly geographically restricted haplotypes from New Caledonia have wide geographical distributions, reaching as far as Taiwan. Main conclusionsThe distribution of Pacific Chrysogorgia is characterized by high levels of rarity, patchiness and diversity, with the levels of seamount-scale and seamount-chain-scale endemism higher than in the Atlantic. We hypothesize that the contrast between the wide geographical distribution of Atlantic Chrysogorgia haplotypes and the higher proportion of endemics in the Pacific is largely explained by differences in depth between the seamounts of these two regions."
"AimWe assess genetic differentiation among biogeographical provinces and colour morphs of the threadfin butterflyfish, Chaetodon auriga. This species is among the most broadly distributed butterflyfishes in the world, occurring on reefs from the Red Sea and western Indian Ocean to French Polynesia and Hawai'i. The Red Sea form lacks a conspicuous eye-spot' on the dorsal fin, which may indicate an evolutionary distinction. LocationRed Sea, Indian Ocean and Pacific Ocean. MethodsSpecimens were obtained at 17 locations (n=358) spanning the entire range of this species. The genetic data included 669 base pairs of mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) cytochrome b and allele frequencies at six microsatellite loci. Analysis of molecular variance, structure plots, haplotype networks and estimates of population expansion time were used to assess phylogeographical patterns. ResultsPopulation structure was low overall, but significant and concordant between molecular markers (mtDNA: (ST)=0.027, P<0.001; microsatellites: F-ST=0.023, P<0.001). Significant population-level partitions were only detected at peripheral locations including the Red Sea and Hawai'i. Population expansion events in the Red Sea and Socotra are older (111,940-223,881years) relative to all other sites (16,343-87,910years). Main conclusionsWe find little genetic evidence to support an evolutionary partition of a previously proposed Red Sea subspecies. The oldest estimate of population expansion in the Red Sea and adjacent Gulf of Aden indicates a putative refuge in this region during Pleistocene glacial cycles. The finding of population separations at the limits of the range, in the Red Sea and Hawai'i, is consistent with peripheral speciation."
"AimGreater understanding of the processes underlying biological invasions is required to determine and predict invasion risk. Two subspecies of olive (Olea europaea subsp. europaea and Olea europaea subsp. cuspidata) have been introduced into Australia from the Mediterranean Basin and southern Africa during the 19th century. Our aim was to determine to what extent the native environmental niches of these two olive subspecies explain the current spatial segregation of the subspecies in their non-native range. We also assessed whether niche shifts had occurred in the non-native range, and examined whether invasion was associated with increased or decreased occupancy of niche space in the non-native range relative to the native range. LocationSouth-eastern Australia, Mediterranean Basin and southern Africa. MethodsEcological niche models (ENMs) were used to quantify the similarity of native and non-native realized niches. Niche shifts were characterized by the relative contribution of niche expansion, stability and contraction based on the relative occupancy of environmental space by the native and non-native populations. ResultsNative ENMs indicated that the spatial segregation of the two subspecies in their non-native range was partly determined by differences in their native niches. However, we found that environmentally suitable niches were less occupied in the non-native range relative to the native range, indicating that niche shifts had occurred through a contraction of the native niches after invasion, for both subspecies. Main conclusionsThe mapping of environmental factors associated with niche expansion, stability or contraction allowed us to identify areas of greater invasion risk. This study provides an example of successful invasions that are associated with niche shifts, illustrating that introduced plant species are sometimes readily able to establish in novel environments. In these situations the assumption of niche stasis during invasion, which is implicitly assumed by ENMs, may be unreasonable."
"AimThe ecological effects of biological invasions are well documented, but little is known about the effects of invaders on the genetic structure of native species. We examined the phylogeography, genetic variation and population structuring of two galaxiid fishes, Aplochiton zebra and A.taeniatus, threatened by non-native salmonids, and whose conservation is complicated by misidentification and limited knowledge of their genetic diversity. LocationChile and the Falkland Islands. MethodsWe combined microsatellite and mitochondrial DNA (16S rDNA and COI) markers to compare genetic diversity, effective population size and gene flow of Aplochiton spp. populations differentially affected by salmonid presence. ResultsWe identified two 16S rDNA haplotypes among A.zebra - one dominant in coastal populations and another dominant in inland populations. Populations living on the island of Chiloe displayed a mixture of coastal and inland haplotypes, as well as high microsatellite diversity, as one would expect if the island had been a refugium during the Last Glacial Maximum, or a contact zone among populations. Microsatellite data revealed strong population structuring, indicative of current isolation patterns, and a negative correlation between the genetic diversity of A.zebra and the relative abundance of invasive salmonids. Main conclusionsOur study indicates that population structuring of A.zebra reflects the influence of historical patterns of migration, but also the current levels of reduced gene flow among watersheds. Invasive salmonids, known to compete with and prey on native galaxiids, may have had negative impacts on the genetic diversity of Aplochiton spp. The low genetic variation found in some populations, coupled with potential biases in abundance estimates due to species misidentification, highlight the urgent need for more research into the conservation status of the two species of Aplochiton."
"AimClimate change is currently altering the geographical distribution of species, but how this process contributes to biogeographical variation in ecological traits is unknown. Range-shifting species are predicted to encounter and respond to new selective regimes during their expansion phase, but also carry historical adaptations to their ancestral range. We sought to identify how historical and novel components of the environment interact to shape latitudinal trends in thermal tolerance, thermal tolerance breadth and phenotypic plasticity of a range-shifting species. LocationSouthern and central Sweden. MethodsTo evaluate phenotypic responses to changes in the thermal selective environment, we experimentally determined the upper and lower thermal tolerances of >2000 wild-caught damselflies (Ischnura elegans) from populations distributed across core and expanding range-edge regions. We then identified changing correlations between thermal tolerance, climate and recent weather events across the range expansion. Niche modelling was employed to evaluate the relative contributions of varying climatic selective regimes to overall habitat suitability for the species in core versus range-edge regions. ResultsUpper thermal tolerance exhibited local adaptation to climate in the core region, but showed evidence of having been released from thermal selection during the current range expansion. In contrast, chill coma recovery exhibited local adaptation across the core region and range expansion, corresponding to increased climatic variability at higher latitudes. Adaptive plasticity of lower thermal tolerances (acclimation ability) increased towards the northern, expanding range edge. Main conclusionsOur results suggest micro-evolutionary mechanisms for several large-scale and general biogeographical patterns, including spatially and latitudinally invariant heat tolerances (Brett's rule) and increased thermal acclimation rates and niche breadths at higher latitudes. Population-level processes unique to climate-mediated range expansions may commonly underpin many broader, macro-physiological trends."
"AimEvaluation of the generality of the diversity-elevation relationship has highlighted effects of scale (spatial extent and grain size) on pattern perception. In contrast, the effects of scale on the attribution of drivers of diversity along elevational gradients remain largely unexplored. This is important because many causal factors have been proposed, and remotely sensed data about abiotic factors are available at increasingly fine grain sizes. Here, we evaluate the effects both of the resolution of the species diversity estimate on the pattern perceived, and of environmental predictor grain size on the potential contribution to each pattern. LocationRuby Mountains, Nevada, western North America. MethodsFor the small mammal fauna along one local elevational gradient, we compared patterns among estimates of richness derived from site-based occurrences rarefied by survey effort and those inferred from interpolation across species' elevational ranges. Using an information-theoretic approach, we evaluated the relative importance of spatial and environmental factors in structuring each richness distribution. Climate and habitat were assessed at coarse and fine grain sizes. Comparisons were based on model fit and relative variable importance. ResultsWe find general congruence in the diversity-elevation relationship, with peak diversity near the midpoint of the sampled gradient. Despite this commonality in pattern, we find the attribution of underlying drivers is substantially influenced by the type of richness estimate and by the grain size of the predictor variables. Main conclusionsOur results illustrate that the factors identified as predictors of diversity can be sensitive to grain size, and that this sensitivity is not equally apparent under different measures of richness obtained from the same survey data. We call for broader discussion of scale effects and resolution appropriateness for elevational diversity gradients. This is particularly important because mismatches in scale may result in misguided conservation or management initiatives."
"AimApex predators often exert strong, top-down effects on ecosystems, and their removal can result in the dramatic reorganization of ecosystems owing to herbivores and smaller predators becoming the dominant trophic-regulating species. However, field studies designed to understand the influence that apex predators have on ecosystems are hampered by the large spatial and temporal scales required. Here, we use pre-existing datasets to test predictions on the direct and indirect effects of apex predators on mammals and vegetation generated from trophic cascade theory and the mesopredator release hypothesis. LocationForests of south-eastern Australia. MethodsWe applied quantile regression to published data collected at 44 sites during the 1980s and 1990s. We investigated inter-relationships between abundance indices of an apex predator, the dingo (Canis dingo), introduced mesopredators, herbivores, ground-dwelling medium-sized mammals and small mammals, and inter-relationships between habitat complexity and abundances of dingoes and macropods. Quantile regression is well suited for investigating limiting factors of response variables, especially when the observations are made at large temporal and spatial scales. ResultsIn accordance with trophic cascade theory, dingo abundance was negatively associated with macropod abundance and macropod abundance was negatively associated with habitat complexity; however, dingo abundance was not correlated with habitat complexity. Similarly, in accordance with the mesopredator release hypothesis, dingo abundance was correlated negatively with red fox abundance and red fox abundance was negatively associated with the abundance of ground-dwelling medium-sized mammals, but, dingo abundance was not correlated with the abundance of medium-sized ground-dwelling mammals. Main conclusionsOur results suggest that the direct suppressive effects of the dingo on macropods and foxes occur simultaneously, but that their indirect effects on lower trophic levels are comparatively weak. Our study provides evidence that the effects of apex predators on other species can be exerted across large spatial scales and become manifest on species at multiple trophic levels."
"AimWe have three goals. (1) To develop a suite of functionally relevant climate variables for modelling vegetation distribution on arid and semi-arid landscapes of the Great Basin, USA. (2) To compare the predictive power of vegetation distribution models based on mechanistically proximate factors (water deficit variables) and factors that are more mechanistically removed from a plant's use of water (precipitation). (3) To quantify the climate gradients that control shrub distributions in a cold desert environment. LocationThe central basin and range ecoregion of the western USA (36-42 degrees N). MethodsWe used a modified Thornthwaite method to derive monthly water balance variables and to depict them using a water balance climograph. Eighteen variables were calculated from the climograph, representing different components of the seasonal water balance. These were used in boosted regression tree models to derive distribution models for 18 desert shrub species. The water balance approach was compared with an approach that used bioclimatic variables derived from the PRISM (Parameter-elevation Relationships on Independent Slopes Model) climate data. ResultsThe water balance and bioclimatic approaches yielded models with similar performance in predicting the geographical distribution of most shrub species. Cumulative annual climatic water deficit was consistently the most important water balance variable for predicting shrub type distributions, although predictions were improved by the inclusion of variables that describe the seasonal distribution of water balance such as water supply in the spring, fall actual evapotranspiration, monsoonality and summer decline in actual evapotranspiration. Main conclusionsThe water balance and bioclimatic approaches to species distribution modelling both yielded similar prediction accuracies. However, the water balance approach offers advantages over the bioclimatic approach because it is mechanistically derived to approximate physical processes important for plant growth."
"AimOur aim was to discriminate different species of Pinus via pollen analysis in order to assess the responses of particular pine species to orbital and millennial-scale climate changes, particularly during the last glacial period. LocationModern pollen grains were collected from current pine populations along transects from the Pyrenees to southern Iberia and the Balearic Islands. Fossil pine pollen was recovered from the south-western Iberian margin core MD95-2042. MethodsWe measured a set of morphological traits of modern pollen from the Iberian pine species Pinus nigra, P.sylvestris, P.halepensis, P.pinea and P.pinaster and of fossil pine pollen from selected samples of the last glacial period and the early to mid-Holocene. Classification and regression tree (CART) analysis was used to establish a model from the modern dataset that discriminates pollen from the different pine species and allows identification of fossil pine pollen at the species level. ResultsThe CART model was effective in separating pollen of P.nigra and P.sylvestris from that of the Mediterranean pine group (P.halepensis, P.pinea and P.pinaster). The pollen of Pinus nigra diverged from that of P.sylvestris by having a more flattened corpus. Predictions using this model suggested that fossil pine pollen is mainly from P.nigra in all the samples analysed. Pinus sylvestris was more abundant in samples from Greenland stadials than Heinrich stadials, whereas Mediterranean pines increased in samples from Greenland interstadials and during the early to mid-Holocene. Main conclusionsMorphological parameters can be successfully used to increase the taxonomic resolution of fossil pine pollen at the species level for the highland pines (P.nigra and P.sylvestris) and at the group of species level for the Mediterranean pines. Our study indicates that P.nigra was the dominant component of the last glacial south-western/central Iberian pinewoods, although the species composition of these woodlands varied in response to abrupt climate changes."
"AimCoastal marine environments experience a wide range of biotic and abiotic forces that can limit and punctuate the geographical range and abundance of species through time. Determining the relative strengths and nonlinear effects of these processes is vital to understanding the biogeographical structures of species. There has been an ongoing discussion concerning the relative importance of these processes in controlling the dynamics of giant kelp, Macrocystis pyrifera, an important structure-forming species on shallow reefs in the eastern Pacific. We used novel spatial time-series that span nearly three decades to determine the dominant drivers of giant kelp canopy biomass and the temporal and spatial scales over which they operate across the dominant range of the giant kelp in North America. LocationNear-shore areas from Ano Nuevo, California, to the USA/Mexico border. MethodsWe employed empirical orthogonal functions to elucidate the primary drivers of giant kelp canopy biomass across space and time and then fit generalized additive and linear models to determine the nonlinear effect and relative importance of each of these potential drivers along the c. 1500-km study region over a 25-year period. ResultsWave disturbance, nitrate availability and the state of the North Pacific Gyre Oscillation were the most important environmental predictors of giant kelp canopy biomass, explaining 24.5%, 12.7% and 6.1% of the variance, respectively. Environmental drivers of canopy biomass exhibited profound spatial differences in relative effect sizes. Nonlinear effect shapes of each potential biomass driver were determined, which explained these spatial differences. Main conclusionsThese large-scale analyses help to reconcile the local-scale conclusions of canopy biomass dynamics across the California coastline and show that these dynamics differ predictably in space and time in accordance with local and regional differences in environmental drivers. By characterizing the nonlinear effects of these drivers, we identified spatio-temporal patterns of processes that cannot be detected by remote sensing."
"Novel ecosystems are anthropogenic landscapes that cannot be returned to their original ecological status. Little is known the social-ecological dynamics of these never-before-seen ecosystems. Less is known of their implications for society, sustainability and transitioning. This literature review contends that novel ecosystems may be regarded as exemplars of social-ecological resilience and that the exploration of potential opportunities within novel ecosystem theory is being constrained by a lack of investigation. Societal values in relation to novel ecosystems are unknown. Since societal values can influence conservation and restoration policies and practice, it is suggested that future policy prescriptions will need to explore the fundamentals this emerging relationship. It could be contended that such complex issues such as novel ecosystems will demand a science of transition, where the desire is to combine the science of discovery and science of engagement into a normative framework for societal change based on reality and realistic objectives and goals."
"Habitat fragmentation can have contrasting effects on species and their interactions within communities, changing community structure and function. Parasitoids and pathogens are key natural enemies in invertebrate communities, but their responses to fragmentation have not been explored within the same community. This study aimed to explore the scale-dependent effects of habitat fragmentation on the population density of a lepidopteran host and particularly its trophic interactions with a specialist parasitoid and virus. Host density and host larval-mortality from the parasitoid and the virus were measured in twelve isolated sites and thirteen connected sites. An index of habitat isolation was created based on the amount of suitable habitat surrounding sites at a range of spatial scales (0.1-5 km radii), and the direct and indirect effects of habitat isolation were analysed using generalised linear mixed effects models. Consistent with predictions, habitat isolation had direct negative effects on host density at the smallest and largest spatial scales, and indirect negative effects on host mortality from the virus at the largest scale, but in contrast to predictions it had direct positive effects on parasitism at small and medium scales. Higher trophic level species may still display responses to habitat fragmentation contrary to predictions based on well supported theory and empirical evidence. The mechanisms underlying these responses may be elucidated by studying responses, contrary to expectations, shared by related species. Developing general predictions about the responses of host-pathogen interactions to fragmentation will require greater understanding of the system-specific mechanisms by which fragmentation can influence pathogen transmission."
"The identification of habitat structures with biologically meaningful links to habitat quality has enabled an increased understanding of wildlife distributions in fragmented landscapes. However, knowledge is lacking of where these structures occur in the landscape. For a broad-scale agricultural landscape, we investigated how the occurrence and abundance of wildlife habitat structures is related to abiotic conditions and land management practices, and whether this differed between old growth and regrowth woodland. We used generalised linear mixed models to investigate the distribution of eight habitat structures in the South-West Slopes bioregion of south-eastern Australia. Only one habitat structure, canopy depth, was related to abiotic conditions alone, whereas only leaf litter cover was related to land management practices only. Each of the other structures (abundance of logs, large trees, hollow-bearing trees, mid-sized trees and dead trees, and amount of native grass cover) was related to a combination and/or interaction of abiotic conditions and land management practices. Old growth woodland had higher log, large tree and hollow-bearing tree abundance, whereas regrowth woodland had higher mid-sized tree and dead tree abundance. Our findings inform key management prescriptions that can be used to improve conservation efforts so they have strong, quantifiable effects on wildlife habitat in temperate agricultural landscapes. Our case study shows that by understanding how management actions in specific abiotic conditions lead to the increased occurrence or abundance of particular habitat structures, management can be spatially targeted to alternative conservation strategies relevant to the landscape of interest."
"Most current methods to assess connectivity begin with landscape resistance maps. The prevailing resistance models are commonly based on expert opinion and, more recently, on a direct transformation of habitat suitability. However, habitat associations are not necessarily accurate indicators of dispersal, and thus may fail as a surrogate of resistance to movement. Genetic data can provide valuable insights in this respect. We aim at directly comparing the utility of habitat suitability models for estimating landscape resistance versus other approaches based on actual connectivity data. We develop a framework to compare landscape resistance models based on (1) a genetic-based multi model optimization and (2) a direct conversion of habitat suitability into landscape resistance. We applied this framework to the endangered brown bear in the Cantabrian Range (NW Spain). We found that the genetic-based optimization produced a resistance model that was more related to species movement than were models produced by direct conversion of habitat suitability. Certain land cover types and transport infrastructures were restrictive factors for species occurrence, but did not appear to impede the brown bear movements that determined observed genetic structure. In this study case, habitat suitability is not synonymous with permeability for dispersal, and does not seem to provide the best way to estimate actual landscape resistance. We highlight the general utility of this comparative approach to provide a comprehensive and practical assessment of factors involved in species movements, with the final aim of improving the initiatives to enhance landscape connectivity in conservation planning."
"The replacement of native vegetation by exotic grasses for livestock production is driving landscape homogenization, habitat fragmentation and reducing connectivity between habitat patches in floodplains ecosystems. In this context we examined how changes in native and exotic vegetation cover, connectivity and water depth affect the attributes of the small [standard length (SL) < 80 mm as adults] and large-sized fish assemblages (SL a parts per thousand yen 80 mm as adults). We assessed the effects of water depth, exotic and native vegetation cover and habitat connectivity on the abundance, species richness, body size and biomass of fish assemblages in a 25 km(2) area of the seasonal habitats of the Pantanal wetland over 5 years. We showed that fish assemblage response to meso-scale variation in water depth, vegetation cover and habitat connectivity in seasonal habitats is size-dependent. The gradient from exotic to natural vegetation cover did not affect the assemblages of small-sized fish, which were mostly regulated by water depth, habitat connectivity and the gradient from grassland to forest. However, besides being affected by water depth and habitat connectivity, large-sized fish were also affected by the gradient from exotic to natural vegetation cover. Our results indicate that transformations in the landscape and changes in the dynamics of inundation may have negative consequences for the long-term persistence of fish assemblages in the Pantanal wetlands."
"Habitat fragmentation is likely to have deleterious genetic consequences for plant populations. Although the genetic effects of fragmentation in plants have been investigated in various landscapes, such studies are scarce in urban landscapes where forests tend to be fragmented and have a complex internal structure. This study aimed to determine the factors, including patch and sub-patch level spatial factors, affecting the genetic diversity of a herbaceous species in urban fragmented forests. We collected 30-39 leaf samples of Viola grypoceras A. Gray var. grypoceras, a perennial herbaceous species with short-distance seed dispersal, from 12 fragmented and 12 suburban forests each at Kyoto City, Japan, and analyzed the genetic diversity of this species by developing six simple sequence repeat markers. Field survey was conducted to collect demographic and spatial data. There was no significant difference in allelic richness between the urban fragmented and suburban forests. However, statistical analysis revealed that the area of vegetation, distribution pattern of populations in a forest, and average distance between nearest populations affected the genetic diversity of this species in urban fragmented forests. Although V. grypoceras has traits that allow it to tolerate fragmentation, such as self-pollination and seed bank-formation ability, pure loss of habitat and reduced fragment size might have deleterious effects on this species, and these effects might become more apparent if fragmentation continues to proceed in the future."
"Although amphibian distributions are associated with environmental moisture at global and local scales, less is known about how desiccation tolerance influences landscape distributions of amphibians. We evaluated two hypotheses linking amphibian distributions in a fragmented tropical forest landscape to desiccation risk. The patch quality hypothesis predicts that desiccation-prone species are absent on small forest patches, which are generally warmer and drier than large patches. Alternatively, the matrix effects hypothesis suggests that desiccation-prone species are absent on isolated forest patches surrounded by open savanna because they will be unable to traverse the matrix in which patches occur. We quantified interspecific variation in desiccation proneness using field-based desiccation trials, and tested for associations between desiccation proneness and distributions of amphibians in fragmented forest in northeastern Bolivia. Rates of evaporative water loss were negatively associated with an index of dispersal limitation, but unrelated to species' area requirements. By demonstrating that desiccation-prone species do not occur on isolated forest patches, we provide clear support for the matrix effects hypothesis. We suggest that desiccation proneness is a key trait that may determine amphibian responses to a range of global change drivers, including habitat loss and fragmentation, invasive species, and climate change."
"Variation in biological communities is used to identify biodiversity responses to anthropogenic drivers, and to guide conservation responses. Often, such data are only available for a limited group of species, with uncertain applicability to unmonitored taxa. Using equivalent data on the community structure of two contrasting taxa, we examine spatial co-variation in both communities, and test the extent to which any associations may result from large-scale latitudinal patterns, variation in habitat-type, or other factors. Birds and butterflies were surveyed using standard methods across a stratified random sample of 1-km(2) squares across the UK. Four measures of community structure were calculated and used to examine their association between the two taxa, before accounting for effects of latitude, habitat-type and observer. Species richness, diversity and community specialisation were significantly correlated between birds and butterflies, but evenness was not. There were strong latitudinal gradients in bird community specialisation, and butterfly richness and diversity. Habitat diversity significantly affected bird communities, whilst butterfly evenness and specialisation was reduced on farmland and human-related habitats. Covariation in richness and diversity between taxa remained after including effects of latitude and habitat-type. Surrogacy approaches may be useful when considering fine-scale variation in species richness and diversity to inform site-based conservation and management decisions. However, limited covariance in evenness and specialisation metrics suggest that decisions based on the needs of rare or specialist species may be less relevant to other taxa."
"Historical carbon storage prior to widespread forest clearing is uncertain. We examined aboveground biomass in historical (1847-1908) and current (2004-2008) mixed and broadleaf forests of Minnesota. Our objective was to compare aboveground forest biomass density and total aboveground carbon storage for two forest types with different historical and current disturbance regimes. We used densities and diameter distributions from historical and current tree surveys and applied relationships between diameter and biomass to estimate biomass in historical and current forests for larger trees with diameters a parts per thousand yen12.7 cm. In the 8.5 million ha Northern Mixed Forest ecological division of Minnesota, historical forests ecosystems under a stand-replacing fire regime that produced high density forests contained greater aboveground biomass density (98 Mg/ha) than current forests (53 Mg/ha) disturbed by frequent tree cutting. Historical total carbon storage was 333 TgC and current carbon storage was 158 TgC; estimates depended on diameter distribution and historical forested extent. In the 4.5 million ha Eastern Broadleaf Forest division, historical forests under a frequent surface fire regime that produced low density oak savannas contained less biomass density (54 Mg/ha) than current dense eastern broadleaf forests (93 Mg/ha). Historical total carbon storage was 79 TgC and current carbon storage was 31 TgC, depending on diameter distribution and forested extent. Total carbon storage appears to be unrealized due to potential for tree diameter increases in both divisions, stem density increases in the Northern Mixed Forest, and forested extent increases in the Eastern Broadleaf Forest."
"The loss of landscape heterogeneity is causing declines of farmland biodiversity around the world. Traditional farmland regions are often highly heterogeneous and harbor high biodiversity, but are under threat of land cover homogenization due to changing agricultural practices. One species potentially affected by landscape homogenization is the Corncrake (Crex crex), which is threatened in Western Europe but remains widespread in the traditional farmland regions of Eastern Europe. In this study we present a case study aiming to assess the potential threat of landscape homogenization for the Corncrake in Romania. We first examined current Corncrake distribution in relation to woody vegetation cover, landscape heterogeneity, and topography (measured at three different spatial scales), as well as human disturbance, throughout the existing agricultural mosaic. Second, we predicted potential future distribution of suitable Corncrake habitat in response to land cover homogenization by simulating a reduction in land cover diversity. Corncrakes were present in grassland and arable fields, and preferentially occupied remote areas that were wet and flat, and had high land cover diversity at the 100 ha scale. The simulation of land cover diversity loss revealed that even a moderate reduction of land cover diversity could drastically reduce the extent of suitable Corncrake habitat. Our findings show the high conservation value of traditional heterogeneous farmland for the Corncrake. Therefore, to protect the Corncrake in traditional farmland, pro-active policy measures should encourage the continuation of mixed farming practices to maintain a diversity of land covers."
"The Florida Everglades has diminished in size and its existing wetland hydrology has been altered. The endangered snail kite (Rostrhamus sociabilis) has nearly abandoned the Everglades, and its prey, the apple snail (Pomacea paludosa), has declined. We developed a population model (EverSnail) to understand apple snail response to inter- and intra-annual fluctuations in water depths over the Everglades landscape. EverSnail was developed as a tool to understand how apple snails respond to different hydrologic scenarios. EverSnail is an age- and size-structured, spatially-explicit landscape model of P. paludosa in the Everglades. Landscape-level inputs are water depth and air temperature. We conducted sensitivity analyses by running EverSnail with +/- 20 % the baseline value of eight parameters. EverSnail was sensitive to changes in survival and water depth associated with reproduction. The EverSnail population varied with changes and/or differences in depth generally consistent with empirical data; site-specific comparisons to field data proved less reliable. A simulated 3-year wet period resulted in a shift in apple snail distribution, but little change in total abundance over the landscape. In contrast, a simulated 3-year succession of relatively dry years resulted in overall lower snail abundances. Comparisons of model output to empirical data indicate the need for more data to better understand, and eventually parameterize, several aspects of snail ecology in support of EverSnail. A primary value of EverSnail is its capacity to describe the relative response of snail abundance to alternative hydrologic scenarios considered for Everglades water management and restoration."
"The role of ecological processes governing community structure are dependent on the spatial distances among local communities and the degree of habitat heterogeneity at a given spatial scale. Also, they depend on the dispersal ability of the targeted organisms collected throughout a landscape window. We assessed the relative importance of spatial and environmental factors shaping edaphic (Collembola) and epigeous (Carabidae) communities at different scales. The sampling sites were four different landscape windows (1 km(2) square each) in a Mediterranean cork-oak landscape in Portugal. Variance partitioning methods were used to disentangle the relative effects of spatial variables and environmental variables (habitat: data on % of vegetation cover types; management: data on forestry and pasture interventions; landscape: data on landscape metrics e.g., patch size, shape and configuration) across different spatial scales. The relative effects of environmental and spatial factors at different scales varied between Collembola and Carabidae. The pure effect of the environmental component was only significant for carabid beetles and explained a higher percentage of their community variance compared to collembolan communities. The pure effects of the spatial component were generally higher than the environmental component for both groups of soil fauna. Carabid communities responded to landscape features related to the patch connectivity of open areas (grasslands) as well as the shape of cork-oak habitat patches integrating the agro-forest mosaic. Community patterns of surface-dwelling soil fauna may be partly predicted by some features of the landscape, while soil-dwelling communities require ecological assessments at finer spatial scales."
"Over the last decade, we have seen a massive increase in the construction of wind farms in northern Fennoscandia. Wind farms comprising hundreds of wind turbines are being built, with little knowledge of the possible cumulative adverse effects on the habitat use and migration of semi-domesticated free-ranging reindeer. We assessed how reindeer responded to wind farm construction in an already fragmented landscape, with specific reference to the effects on use of movement corridors and reindeer habitat selection. We used GPS-data from reindeer during calving and post-calving in the MalAyen reindeer herding community in Sweden. We analysed data from the pre-development years compared to the construction years of two relatively small wind farms. During construction of the wind farms, use of original migration routes and movement corridors within 2 km of development declined by 76 %. This decline in use corresponded to an increase in activity of the reindeer measured by increased step lengths within 0-5 km. The step length was highest nearest the development and declining with distance, as animals moved towards migration corridors and turned around or were observed in holding patterns while not crossing. During construction, reindeer avoided the wind farms at both regional and landscape scale of selection. The combined construction activities associated with even a few wind turbines combined with power lines and roads in or close to central movement corridors caused a reduction in the use of such corridors and grazing habitat and increased the fragmentation of the reindeer calving ranges."
"Rates, patterns, and consequences of urban expansion are drawing increasing attention globally because of their profound impacts on socioeconomics, human life, and the environment. Horizontal comparative studies across multiple cities over large geographic regions are rare. We quantified and compared the magnitude and forms of urban expansion for China's 32 major cities, and examined the spatiotemporal evolution of urban growth and trajectory of patch structure formation. Multi-temporal Landsat data of circa 1978, 1990, 1995, 2000, 2005, and 2010, patch-based analyses, and urban growth metrics were used. These 32 major cities have experienced extensive expansion during the study period. Leapfrogging was the dominant urban expansion form, followed by edge-expansion and infilling in the early time periods. Interestingly, the fractions of infilling, edge-expansion, and leapfrogging has gradually reached a quasi-equilibrium condition with a ratio of 2:4:4 (the number) and 2:5:3 (the area) during recent years. Patch analysis suggested that these cities evolved under a nationally-consistent converged urban patch structure regardless of city size, location, and history. The dynamics of urban growth in China corresponded well with its socioeconomic and political geography and the phased implementation of various regional and national policies. Our results generally supported the continuum of diffusion-coalescence urbanization process and a spatial self-organization of urban land patches during urbanization. More studies are needed to test the generality of urban growth hypothesis and examine the universality of converged urban patch structure across regions and countries and to understand their implications to city organization, metabolism, and evolution."
"Disentangling the relative effects of forest loss versus fragmentation on species distribution and abundance is crucial for adopting efficient biodiversity conservation actions, which could change with the nature of the landscape matrix. We tested the moderating effect of landscape matrix on insectivorous bats response to forest loss and fragmentation. We conducted acoustic surveys at forest patches surrounded by either an agricultural-dominated matrix or a pine-dominated matrix. We related bat activity to forest amount and the number of forest patches at multiple spatial scales, and compared their effects between landscape matrices. Bat activity was associated with both predictors, however their effects varied with the matrix type. In agricultural landscapes, as the amount of forest increased, the activity of Histiotus montanus, Lasiurus cinereus and Tadarida brasiliensis increased, while activity of Myotis chiloensis decreased. Similarly, as fragmentation increased, the activity of Lasiurus varius and M. chiloensis increased, while activity of H. montanus decreased. In production-forest landscapes, only H. montanus decreased its activity with increasing forest amount. In contrast, activity of L. cinereus, M. chiloensis and T. brasiliensis increased with increasing fragmentation. Forest amount was a stronger predictor for agricultural landscapes than for production-forest landscapes, suggesting that low contrast matrices can mitigate the effects of forest loss. Fragmented landscapes with native forest patches surrounded by a low contrast matrix may support a higher activity of insectivorous bats. Management efforts in fragmented landscapes should aim to decrease the patch-matrix contrast, which will mitigate the effects of forest loss on bats."

"A century ago, an international team of scientists sailed under the Canadian flag to the western Canadian Arctic, via the Bering Strait, to achieve the goals of the Canadian Arctic Expedition of 1913 - 18. This major expedition was a milestone in the history of Canada. The scientists explored a vast, unknown sea and land area that extended from the Alaskan northern coast to Bathurst Inlet in Canada, and from Meighen Island to approximately 160 - 200 km inland from the continental coasts. This area had never been explored by an expedition before, and many parts of it had never been visited (except, presumably, by Inuit and their ancestors). The expedition resulted in a remarkable harvest of terrestrial and marine plants and animals, and associated data. The scientists furthered geographic and scientific knowledge of the Arctic and published 74 reports in various scientific fields, yet none of these addressed vertebrate zoology. The present report attempts to. make up for this deficiency. Overall, the CAE collected and preserved 2084 vertebrate specimens and inventoried 139 species, which together fairly depicted the Arctic vertebrate community. Almost all specimens are preserved at the Canadian Museum of Nature. They significantly supplemented the rather meagre vertebrate collections of the Museum of those times and have since prompted the continuing development of these collections."
"This study documents observations of breeding behavior at two Osprey Pandion haliaetus carolinensis nest sites discovered at Fort Wainwright, Alaska. We developed Osprey location criteria and behavior and activity classifications from observations in 2006 and 2007, and subsequently measured those behaviors and activities at those locations in 2008-10. Eleven separate observers documented breeding behavior in and around each nest site from 2008 to 2010 for a total of 858 hours. Ground-based behavioral observations by researchers from an enclosed vehicle minimized anthropogenic disturbance. This study provides quantitative and qualitative assessments of breeding behavior that includes incubation, brooding, nest defense, and interloper occurrences from 2008 to 2010 and describes breeding timelines, mean brood size, and productivity from 2006 to 2011. Female Ospreys incubated and brooded significantly more than male Ospreys. Behavioral data suggest that breeding adult females and male Ospreys have differing nest and nest area defensive priorities. Breeding timelines and behaviors documented in this study are similar to those described in the literature. This study provides the first account of breeding phenology and behavior for Ospreys in Interior Alaska."
"We conducted systematic aerial surveys of ringed seals along strip transects in western Hudson Bay. (WHB), Canada, in late May to early June of 1995-97, 1999, 2000, 2007-10, and 2013. The density of ringed seals hauled out on ice over the entire study area ranged from 1.22 seals/km(2) in 1995, to 0.20 seals/km(2) in 2013. Density estimates varied significantly over the study period and, with the exception of 2013, appeared to follow a cyclical pattern. Although density estimates also appear to follow a downward trend over time, results of multiple linear regression, weighted by survey effort, indicated no significant trend in ringed seal density as a function of year, survey date, or proportion of open water. In addition, no significant correlation was observed among any of the environmental variables and density estimates. As the proportion of seals hauled out at the time of the survey is unknown, the density estimates of WHB ringed seals presented in this study should be considered indices that might be useful to explore trends in abundance. Although our results do not indicate that a significant decline has occurred, the low density estimate in 2013 may indicate that population changes unrelated to a natural cycle are taking place. We were unable to test for direct effects of changes in food supply or predation, but polar bears, Arctic foxes, and Inuit communities in the Hudson Bay region all would be negatively affected should ringed seal populations undergo significant declines. Further monitoring and directed research are necessary to understand what mechanism may be responsible for the observed changes in ringed seal density."
"Outside of northern Quebec, there is little evidence to confirm reports of nesting by Canada Geese in Arctic habitats of North America, but they nest regularly in the Arctic tundra of West Greenland, from about 62 degrees N to as far north as 76.96 degrees N, 71.11 degrees W. In 2013, we documented successful nesting by a pair of Canada Geese on northern Baffin Island (71.36 degrees N, 79.59 degrees W), approximately 1200 km north of the nearest known site of regular nesting by this species in northern Quebec. Photographs, egg measurements, and mitochondrial DNA evidence confirmed that these were Canada Geese. Egg laying began around 17 June, the nest of five eggs hatched on 18 July, and we determined that fledging should have occurred around 20 September. Daily mean temperatures on northern Baffin Island fell below freezing after 5 September 2013, and we suspect that the probability of recruitment for this brood was very low. Climate warming in the Arctic is likely to favor northward range expansion by Canada Geese."
"Scottish adventurer James Lamont led hunting expeditions to Svalbard (1858 and 1859) and to Svalbard and Novaya Zemlya (1869 to 1871), voyages chronicled in his two publications, Seasons with the Sea-horses (1861) and Yachting in the Arctic Seas (1876). These works were modeled on the English whaler William Scoresby, Jr.'s An Account of the Arctic Regions, with a History and Description of the Northern Whale-Fishery, Vol. 1, written in 1820. Scoresby's book, as well as a correspondence with evolutionary theorist, Charles Darwin, inspired Lamont to pursue science during an Arctic hunt. Lamont's scientific endeavours included geographical surveys, the collection of geological specimens, and basic experiments in physical oceanography. However, most importantly, Lamont provided the first account of Arctic wildlife in the context of natural selection. Lamont's legacy as an Arctic explorer linked the early sea-hunters like Scoresby to a later generation of Victorian hunter-explorers, such as Benjamin Leigh Smith, who followed Lamont's lead and journeyed northward to hunt and conduct scientifically grounded explorations."
"Basic knowledge of the abundance and distribution of birds and their habitats and the relationships between them is limited for many parts of Arctic Canada, including montane regions. This information is important for conservation purposes as bird populations and habitats shift and as interest in development of northern areas increases. We characterized bird communities in the Mackenzie Mountains of the Northwest Territories by conducting point counts (n = 376) in June 2009 and 2010 and using community analysis metrics (multiple response permutation procedures, indicator species analysis, non-metric multidimensional scaling) to statistically and graphically describe bird data in six habitat types: coniferous forest, deciduous forest, shrub (short and tall), alpine tundra, and open water wetlands. Distinct habitats had significantly different bird communities, as shown by using multiple response permutation procedures (p < 0.005). Of 51 species, 32 had significant (p < 0.05) indicator values for one habitat type (n = 15) or groups of habitats (n = 17) in an indicator species analysis. The tall shrub habitat type had the most indicator species (six species) followed by alpine tundra (five species), then the combined conifer, deciduous, and wetland habitat group (four species) and the deciduous forest habitat types (three species). Species richness was highest in the tall shrub (n = 37), alpine (n = 30), and conifer and short shrub (n = 29) habitats. We also observed eight bird species not previously known to occur in the area, or which were outside published ranges. Our results highlight the variability in bird community composition between the major habitat types in the Mackenzie Mountains, serve as a baseline for future bird studies in the region, and underscore the need for more research in the area with impending anthropogenic changes."
"Environmental assessment (EA) is employed across the Arctic to assess, mitigate, and monitor the impacts of resource development. Despite the increasing pressures of resource development on Arctic communities and ecosystems and the growing demands for more efficient and effective EA processes, little is known about the needs and priorities of research that will help us to understand and improve EA and its relevance to Arctic communities. A gap analysis of EA research across eight Arctic nations, based on a review of the scholarly literature, government research and policy documents, and a questionnaire survey of Arctic EA scholars, addressed both project-based EA and strategic EA that focused on policy, planning, and regional assessment. Results indicate seven priority research themes: understanding community and stakeholder expectations about EA; assessing the efficiency and responsiveness of EA to rapidly changing socio-ecological and regulatory environments; examining the influence of EA on development decisions; addressing the capacity for meaningful engagement in EA; strengthening the relationship between EA and land-use planning and Arctic science programs; demonstrating the value of regional EA; and assessing the ability of EA to respond to the reality of climate change. These are not the only areas where further EA research is needed, but they are critical to the effectiveness of EA in the Arctic and to ensuring its relevance to Arctic communities."
"Across the Canadian North, resource co-management has become a central institution for the management of natural resources. Although many multidisciplinary studies have examined the various social and political dimensions that influence the effectiveness of resource co-management, little has been done to understand how gender might affect collaboration and decision making. This gap is particularly evident in the northern Canadian context, where women make up 16% of all current co-management board members. This study examines the relationship between gender and decision making, drawing on the experiences of those involved in co-management boards in Yukon. Our findings indicate that the representation of women within these institutions is important for establishing a holistic decision-making process and a positive institutional culture that facilitates effective decision making. While there were many different experiences with gender, co-management, and decision making, it was generally agreed that male and female board members had equal opportunities to participate in board decision making. Nonetheless, barriers remain that prevent board members from feeling comfortable acting upon these opportunities. These barriers to participation were experienced by men and women in distinct ways. Institutional level barriers-cases where women's skills and knowledge were considered irrelevant to co-management, where their opinions lacked standing within decision making-will be the most challenging for co-management boards to address in regard to effective decision making."
"We studied movement rates and the general flight behavior of bird flocks seen on radar and recorded visually at Northstar Island, Arctic Alaska, from 13 to 27 September 2002. Most of this period (13-19 and 21-27 September) had no gas-flaring events, but a major gas-flaring event occurred on the night of 20 September. Movement rates of targets on radar and of bird flocks recorded visually in the first similar to 50%-60% of the night were much lower during the non-flaring period than during the night of flaring, whereas rates in the last similar to 40%-50% of the night were similar in all periods. The general flight behavior of birds also differed significantly, with higher percentages of both radar targets and bird flocks exhibiting straight-line (directional) flight behaviors during the non-flaring periods and higher percentages of radar targets and bird flocks exhibiting non-straight-line (erratic and circling) flight behaviors during the gas-flaring period. During the night of gas flaring, the bright illumination appeared to have an effect only after sunset, when flocks of birds circled the island after being drawn in from what appeared to be a substantial distance from the island. On both radar and visual sampling, the number of bird flocks approaching the island declined over the evening, and the attractiveness of the light from flaring appeared to decline. The visibility of the moon appeared to have little effect on the behavior of birds. Because illumination from extensive gas-flaring is such a strong attractant to migrating birds and because most bird flocks fly at low altitudes over the water, flaring booms on coastal and offshore oil-production platforms in Arctic Alaska should be positioned higher than the mean flight altitudes of migrating birds to reduce the chances of incineration."
"Food security is a global societal challenge, and one geographic region where food insecurity is increasing is the North American Arctic and Subarctic. In this paper we synthesize research on food security in this region; important precursors and early work include reports on the impacts of land claims, the cumulative effects of industrial development and environmental change, and the health impacts of the nutrition transition among Indigenous peoples. Building on these foundations, food security research in the North has followed a path similar to that taken in the global food security literature, beginning with nutritional adequacy and security of food supplies and then downscaling to a focus on issues at the livelihood and household level. Our meta-analysis of the peer-reviewed literature reveals many reasons why people are food-insecure: challenges such as remoteness, climate change, and the high costs of food and fuel all play important roles. However, the primary drivers of food insecurity that we identify in this review relate to governance and policy challenges that have been recognized and critiqued for decades. Recommendations for future research include an improved focus on participatory research and food security interventions that acknowledge and focus on supporting the rights of local peoples to pursue food security on their own terms. This paper is relevant in the context of climatic and environmental change because it captures the role of shifting political ecologies as increased geopolitical interests in the North appear to be obscuring the rights and needs of local peoples to access and control their own land and resources."


"The North Sea and Baltic Sea long-term records reveal a strong correlation (0.997) between sea-level changes and the sum of identified harmonic oscillations, corresponding to the lunar nodal period and four multiples of it. We developed a transparent method for iterative least residual sine regression that is capable of identifying harmonic sea-level oscillations, e.g., gravitational sea-level effects of the lunar nodal oscillation. Three relatively large harmonic sea-level oscillations with period lengths of 18.6 (18.6), 60.5 (55.8), and 76.1 (74.4) years correspond well to factors 1, 3, and 4 of the 18.6-year lunar nodal period (multiple periods in parentheses). The sum of these oscillations leaves small residuals that can be resolved into two further, statistically less significant oscillations with apparent period lengths of 28.1 (27.9) and 111.1 (111.7) years, corresponding to factors 11/2 and 6 of the lunar nodal period. Periods and amplitudes expose strong entrainment, i.e. phase synchronization at rational ratios of the identified oscillations' periods as well as amplitude locking at reciprocal rational ratios of 1/2, 1/3, and 2/3 of the three largest oscillations. On top of the region's general sea-level rise (1.18 mm/y), strong quasi-oscillations occur when the two largest oscillations are in phase. Thus, a large quasi-oscillation commenced in 1971 adding a 40-year sea-level rise of 1.0-1.2 mm/y to the region's general sea-level rise. If our theory is correct, the ongoing quasi-oscillation should culminate in 2011, and the suggestion may be tested after completion of the ongoing 18.6-year nodal oscillation, i.e. in 2020-21. A purely mathematical extension of the oscillation parameters identified by the applied method suggests that the sum of harmonic oscillations produces 223-year pulses of quasi-oscillations, which can be divided into 158-year periods (e.g., 1747-1905 and after 1970) with large oscillations (6065 mm), followed by 65-year periods (e.g., 1905-70) with much smaller oscillations (2-16 mm)."
"Diversion of the Mississippi River is considered the most effective way of offsetting Louisiana's coastal plain land loss. The Wax Lake delta, a man-made diversion that represents mostly sand-rich distributary mouth bar deposits, is cited as a model for land building from a large river diversion. The fine-grained suspended load is mostly deposited outside of ""the delta."" Numerical simulations of diversion delta building focus primarily on sand deposition. The fine-grained suspended load is only secondarily considered. Research results reported here suggest that natural processes associated with the synergistic relationship between floods and cold front passages can effectively distribute suspended sediments to maintain and rebuild wetlands outside the sand-rich delta. Measurements (fixed acoustic Doppler current profilers) of current speed, current direction, and water level in a mainland marsh channel, north of Atchafalaya Bay, indicate that as cold fronts approach, local water levels can be elevated by as much as 1 m, and normal discharge into the bay is reversed so that flow is into the coastal plain marshes. LIDAR bank elevations indicate that overbank flow is initiated by these events. Streamside sediment accretion (2-y monitoring period) using feldspar plots indicates up to 6.8 cm. Longer term Cs-137 data reveal an average sediment accretion rate of >1 cm y(-1) over 50+ years. Marsh flooding results in denitrification of nitrate in river water plus nutrient uptake resulting in increased plant productivity, considerably greater than for similar coastal plain marshes free of riverine sediment input. Fine-grained suspended sediments are important for rebuilding Louisiana's coastal plain, which is naturally constructed mostly of riverine silt and clay plus organic matter."
"Aerial photography was used to determine rates of shoreline change in the New River Estuary (NRE), North Carolina, from 1956 to 2004. The NRE shoreline was digitized from aerial photographs taken in 1956, 1989, and 2004, and shoreline type was determined by ground-truthing the entire shoreline by small boat in 2009. Major shoreline type categories included swamp forest (6% of total), saltmarsh (21%), sediment bank (53%), and modified/hardened (19%). Ground-truthing provided additional details on relief, marsh species composition, and structure type. A point-based, end-point rate approach was used to measure shoreline change rate (SCR) at 50 m intervals for the periods 1956-89, 1989-2004, and 1956-2004. Representative wave energy (RWE) was modeled for each interval using local bathymetry and wind data. Average SCR across all shoreline types for the entire time period ranged from -2.3 to +1.0 m y(-1), with a mean SCR of -0.3 m y(-1). This translates to an average loss of similar to 3 m for any given point over the 48-year period covered by this study. The most negative average SCR (greatest erosion) occurred along unvegetated sediment bank shorelines (-0.39 m y(-1)). Change along marsh shorelines (-0.18 m y(-1)) was lower than along sediment banks, and narrow fringing marsh associated with sediment bank shorelines significantly reduced bank erosion. Modeled RWE values were positively correlated with erosion only in the highest wave-energy settings. Erosion of sediment bank shorelines provides a conservative estimate of 17,660 m(3) of sediment each year to the estuary, with marsh erosion contributing up to an additional 1900m 3 y(-1). Based on analysis of the sediment volume required to maintain marsh surface elevation with respect to sea level, we hypothesize that shoreline erosion plays a vital role in supporting growth and maintenance of downstream marshes."
"The effect of sea-level rise (SLR) on exceedance probabilities for annual flooding at coastal locations is explored in this paper. We assess four future SLR scenarios given by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers and how these SLR scenarios affect monthly flooding statistics. Focusing on one case site, Annapolis, Maryland, we fit the probability density function of the monthly maximum tide gauge record with a Pareto-tail distribution. Random sampling from this distribution is then performed on top of the various future SLR scenarios. Exceedance probabilities for a storm tide to exceed the coastal flood stage, the elevation of which has already been established in a previous paper, are then calculated from the interpolated Pareto cumulative distribution. We illustrate that even mild increases in mean sea level acceleration lead to drastically higher exceedance probabilities of coastal flooding."
"Through assessment of forest structure, biomass of mangrove plantations in the Thanh Phu Nature Reserve, Mekong Delta, Vietnam was analyzed in correlation with diameter at breast height (DBH, i.e. at 1.3 m height). Study plots were set up in 7, 11-22, and 26-year-old planted Rhizophora apiculata Blume plantations. There is a significant inverse correlation between DBH and tree density (R-2 = 0.73; p < 0.01). To derive an allometric relation to estimate aboveground biomass, 32 trees representing all ages were chosen randomly and harvested at ground level to examine allometric relations. We measured the fresh and dry weight of stems (W-S), branches (W-B), leaves (W-L), and aboveground stilt roots (W-R) in situ. Allometric relationships were satisfied best with DBH as an independent variable (R-2 = 0.72, 0.89, 0.87, 0.98, and 0.97 for leaves, branches, stilt roots, stem, and total aboveground biomass, respectively; p < 0.001). The total aboveground biomass was estimated in the plantations to vary between 76 and 320 tons/ha. Of this, more than 50% of total aboveground biomass was represented by stems. The estimated biomass value of this study is consistent with that of other mangroves in the world. Total biomass of R. apiculata plantation in Thanh Phu Nature Reserve accounted for about 170,057 tons dry weight or 8056 tons C."
"This paper presents the Barrier Island Profile (BIP) model, a new computer code developed to simulate barrier island morphological evolution over periods ranging between years and decades under the impacts of accelerated sea-level rise and long-term changes in the storm climate. The BIP model is a multiline model that represents the time-averaged dynamics of major barrier island features from front beach to backshore. Unique contributions of BIP to coastal modeling include a dynamic linking of interacting barrier island features and consideration of both future sea-level rise and storm climate impacts. The BIP model has the built-in capability of conducting Monte Carlo (MC) simulations to quantify predictive uncertainty caused by uncertainty in sea-level rise scenarios and storm parameters. For a series of barrier island cross-sections derived from the characteristics of Santa Rosa Island, Florida, BIP was used to evaluate their responses to random storm events and five potential accelerated rates of sea-level rise projected over a century. The MC simulations using BIP provide multiple realizations of possible barrier island morphologic responses and their statistics, such as mean and variance. The modeling results demonstrate that BIP is capable of simulating realistic patterns of barrier island profile evolution over the span of a century using relatively simple representations of time-and space-averaged processes with consideration of uncertainty of future climate impacts."
"Bird Island, at the oceanic outlet of Australia's largest exoreic river system, the Murray-Darling, did not exist before 1940. Originally, flood tidal sediments were moulded by tides, waves, wind, and river flows in the back-barrier lagoon, landward of the migrating River Murray Mouth. The estuary was fluvially dominated, and the terminal lakes were mainly fresh. Following more than a century of European settlement and freshwater abstraction, salinity levels increased, prompting the construction of barrages (completed in 1940) near the Murray Mouth to restore the former predominantly freshwater character of the estuary. Further reduced river flows, a restricted tidal prism, and management strategies produced irreversible changes in the dynamics of the River Murray Mouth. These are archived in the landforms and vegetation of Bird Island. By the mid-1950s, sand shoals were enlarging and a small patch of vegetation was established, forming the core of an incipient island. Progressively, dunes and salt marshes were established, reflecting intimate associations between landform evolution, vegetation colonisation, and island stability. As the mouth migrated to the NW, so did the flood tidal shoals, the sources for newer generations of dunes, thereby developing a clockwise establishment of dunes on the expanding island. Approximately 1 km in diameter and carrying more than 80 plant species, Bird Island assisted mouth closure in 1981. During the 2002-10 drought, dredging maintained the mouth and improved lagoonal water quality. Subsequent healthy river flows cleared the mouth, highlighting the important role of river flows in maintaining oceanic access, and sediment removal, while flushing the river system. The evolution of Bird Island as documented in this study demonstrates how anthropogenic activities can cause rapid and irrevocable changes to coastal-estuarine environments."
"This paper presents a new analytical approximation for wave (current)-induced dynamic soil response. In this study, unlike in previous research projects, full dynamic soil behaviour was considered. The nonlinear waves propagating over an infinite seabed with uniform current were investigated, and the new analytical solution was validated with the previous field observations and laboratory experiments. The effects of currents and wave nonlinearity were examined based on the proposed analytical solution. Finally, a parametric study was carried out to examine the influence of the wave and seabed characteristics on the seabed response. As the numerical examples demonstrated, the effects of currents on the seabed response are significant only in the top region of the seabed (comprising approximately 10% of the wavelength). Based on parametric study, it is concluded that currents with third-order wave loading and full dynamic soil behaviour cannot always be ignored in the estimation of the wave-induced seabed responses, especially for almost-saturated soil, long-wave periods, and shallow water. A significant difference was also observed in the maximum liquefaction depth between the full dynamic and the consolidation models."
"Beach awards such as the European Blue Flag are increasingly adopted in many countries as an environmental brand to promote better beach management and encourage tourism. However, the validity of the Blue Flag award has been criticized in the literature, and research shows that the award is still not widely known and has marginal influence on tourists' beach selection. This study, conducted at six popular South African beaches, three with and three without Blue Flag status, investigated awareness and evaluation of the Blue Flag award among 579 beachgoers. Results from a structured questionnaire showed that over half of the participants, mostly people on the Blue Flag beaches, knew about the Blue Flag award and its criteria; however, approximately one-third of the participants were unaware of it. Participants tended to be less tolerant of supposed water-quality degradation than the loss of the Blue Flag status, although an exception was made for Margate Beach, where people were less tolerant of a hypothetical loss of Blue Flag status. Although the participants' evaluation of the Blue Flag award was generally positive, for most it was not their main reason for visiting a beach. In the light of these findings, a more coherent implementation of the Blue Flag award and better information propagation in its regard are recommended for South African beaches."
"The wind effect on Kuroshio-induced island wake downstream of Green Island, Taiwan, is studied using a depth-averaged shallow-water model. The seasonal monsoon effect on spatial-temporal scales, such as the aspect ratio, dimensionless width, and Strouhal number, as well as the relative propagation speed of Green Island vortices, is studied. It is found that a NE monsoon has a more pronounced effect on wake characteristics than a SW monsoon does in terms of net speed and vorticity, aspect ratio, and dimensionless width. Vortices are pushed back and packed close to the north of the island with a smaller area of recirculation when Kuroshio flows against the NE monsoon; vortices are pushed farther downstream with a larger area of recirculation when Kuroshio flows in favor of the SW monsoon. However, the wind effect on temporal variation of island wake seems less significant. The period of vortex shedding is between 14.2 and 15.3 hours. The corresponding Strouhal number is between 0.116 and 0.125, and the relative propagation speed of vortices is nondimensional, between 0.51 and 0.56. These values are in good agreement with the results of previous reports."
"With extensive use of satellite-measured climatology, the present study investigated the upwelling along the entire west coast of India and authenticated the differences in upwelling along the SW and NW coasts. During May and September, the entire west coast of India was characterized by weak offshore surface mass transport. During June, July, and August, offshore surface mass transport was limited to SW coast of India, and onshore transport was observed along NW coast, except at 16 degrees N and 17 degrees N, where very weak offshore transport was observed, compared with SW coast. Analysis of the Sea Surface Height Anomaly, depth of 26 degrees isotherms, and Local Temperature Anomaly revealed the role of remote forcing on the upwelling along the west coast of India, especially during the peak summer monsoon months. The observations on the Local Temperature Anomaly at different depth levels exposed that, at the surface, the upwelling features was limited to the SW coast of India during the summer monsoon. Upwelling, however, was clearly evident at the 10-m depth along the NW coast during May and September. The main difference in upwelling along the SW and NW coastlines during June to August was that vertical excursion of upwelled water along the NW coast was limited to the 30-m depth and along the SW coast; the upwelled water replaces the surface water. From Local Temperature Anomaly it was also evident that the intensity and south to north propagation speed of upwelling was more at deeper level than at the surface."
"A numerical and experimental study was performed to investigate the wave control characteristics of general perforated harbor structures under irregular wave conditions. A numerical analysis using a boundary element method was applied to each of the regular wave components composing the irregular wave, and the results were linearly superimposed under linear wave assumptions. The nonlinear friction term at the perforated walls was first linearized using the root mean square values of horizontal velocity components obtained through an iterative calculation. Hydraulic experiments were also performed for three different transmissive structures, and the results were compared with those of the numerical analysis. The numerical and experimental values of reflection and transmission coefficients generally agreed within an accuracy of 0.1. The numerical analysis was also applied to a nontransmissive structure with a single wave chamber from a previous experiment and showed good agreement with those experimental results."
"As sea levels rise, the distribution and community structure of coastal ecosystems are expected to change. In many coastal aquifers, fresher groundwater floats on top of denser saltwater and will rise with sea level. Under these conditions, ecosystems dependent on groundwater may shift inland as a result of inundation, changes in salinity, or both. Groundwater-fed anchialine pool habitats existing in porous coastal substrates around the world have not been assessed for sea-level rise impacts. As a first step toward examining ecosystem response to rising water levels, geospatial models were developed to detect anchialine pools on the island of Hawai'i at current water levels and models were validated with known pool locations. Specifically, the objectives were to determine whether accounting for groundwater levels in the model improved pool detection, to identify the model that most accurately detected known pools, and to identify which pool features make some pools more likely to be detected than others. Six water level models were validated with the test data set of actual pool locations to determine how well they detected known anchialine pools. Water surface models that included groundwater levels were up to 37% better at detecting anchialine pools than corresponding models without groundwater levels. The model that included groundwater levels at mean higher high water was applied to 42 km of coastline where it correctly detected 62% of known pools. A generalized linear model showed that pools with surface areas greater than 5 m(2) and pools without canopy were the most likely to be detected. Future predictive modeling of anchialine pool response to sea-level rise should include groundwater levels. Furthermore, geospatial models aimed at predicting ecosystem shifts due to sea level rise may be improved by including groundwater as a factor and should be validated using current ecosystem conditions."
"Coastal water quality plays an important role in people's lives. In this study, the coastal water of the Penghu archipelago was used as a research object. Three types of multivariate methods-factor analysis, cluster analysis, and multivariate scaling-were employed to analyze the spatial features of oil pollution, and the results of these three methods were compared with regard to the causes of pollution. Factor analysis showed that oil concentration subregions, composed of the first four principal components, accounted for 84.8% of the oil concentration variance. The contour maps of factor loadings of each principal component, combined with the distribution of pollution sources, the direction of seawater flow, etc., might be appropriate to interpret the pollution patterns represented by each principal component. Based on the comparison of the advantages and disadvantages of the three multivariate methods used to explain the geographical features of oil concentration, factor analysis was the best analytic approach in that it could provide information of proportional contributions from a variety of pollution sources on oil concentration variance; it also provided appropriate spatial classification results and a classification number. Factor analysis and multivariate scaling could divide the region into four subregions with consistent oil concentrations. The possible pollution sources in each subregion could be interpreted by locations of sources, contour maps of factor loadings, and relevant factors. Although cluster analysis could differentiate the concentrations measured by all observation stations, its geographical classification result was worse than those of the other two methods."
"Three cities in Brazil-Rio de Janeiro, Niteroi, and Sao Goncalo-with an estimated total population of 11 million people, are located in the surroundings of Guanabara Bay (RJ-Brazil), making it a highly contaminated coastal system. Because of its importance, Guanabara Bay has been one of the most studied coastal environments in Brazil. Despite that, this study represents the first investigation, to our knowledge, to couple benthic foraminifera with the quantity and quality of organic matter in the area. The spatial distribution of water salinity and the surface sediment reduction potential, grain size, total organic carbon, sulfur, bacterial organic carbon, biopolymers such as carbohydrates, proteins, lipids, bacterial enzyme esterase, and total foraminiferal assemblages were studied at 30 stations in Guanabara Bay. Based on these data, six bottom environments-industrial, marginal urban, marginal urban/industrial mixing, eutrophic, transitional, and outer-were identified and described."
"Beaches and dunes dampen wave energy and protect against storm surge. This protection is not uniform and varies according to geomorphic characteristics along the coast. Barrier island communities should identify the protection afforded by beaches and dunes to better assess their vulnerability and inform decision making regarding management alternatives. Our study presents a classification identifying a theoretical level of protection that beaches and foredunes could provide against overwash resulting from a tropical storm or hurricane along Mustang and North Padre Islands, Texas. In addition, a monetary valuation of this protective function is estimated at a site level. The theoretical level of storm protection was determined by assessing the response of representative beach-dune profiles to a set of synthetic storms and identifying the storm level at which profiles were overwashed. A monetary value was then assigned to the storm protection function of beach-dune profiles using a replacement cost approach. The level of protection afforded by beaches and foredunes varies across the islands. Some areas are more vulnerable to overwash and inundation during low-intensity storms. About 50% of the assessed beach-dune profiles provide overwash protection against at least a 100-year storm. Areas with the highest protection levels (100 and 200 y) share the following characteristics: (1) they have high dunes (>4 m in elevation), (2) they are in largely undeveloped areas or where buildings are at least 150 to 200 m landward of the line of vegetation, and (3) they generally have a wider beach-foredune complex width. The total annual value of the storm protection function of beaches and foredunes is estimated to be $141.4 million (USD 2013, replacement cost equivalent)."
"This paper proposes a method to calculate the total cost of a floating offshore wind farm. The method is based on the phases of the life cycle of such a farm. Each phase is defined by a cost, the value of which is either a constant or a variable parameter depending on the characteristics of a particular region. The tool so developed results in a georeferenced map of the total cost implied in the development of a floating offshore wind farm. Additionally, this method is applied to a floating offshore wind farm located in Galicia (in northwest Spain), as well as the three most important types of floating platforms: semisubmersible, tensioned leg, and spar. This paper is novel in that it helps to estimate the economics of floating offshore wind farms. In this sense, this study is one of the first of its kind to calculate the various costs associated with these types of wind farms."
"Coastal human populations are expanding and affecting plant communities, in particular dune systems. Coastal communities face risks from storm events, while coastal dune systems are heavily affected by human population and recreation pressures. Here, we evaluate the impacts of human disturbance (beach access paths) on vegetative cover and plant diversity in coastal dunes on the Isle of Palms, South Carolina. Transects were created in the foredune, middune, and backdune vegetation communities, and plots were placed 0, 1.5, 5, 10, and 20 m from a path to assess the impacts of three types of paths (public sand paths, private sand paths, and private wooden paths) at these distances on diversity, abundance, and measures of cover. Results indicate that beach access paths reduce biodiversity and density of beach dune vegetation. Sand paths contribute to greater reductions in vegetative cover than all wooden paths. Raised wooden paths compared to those at the sand surface have the least reduction in vegetation cover. Areas between closely spaced paths had reduced species richness and reduced percentage of vegetative cover compared to areas where paths were spaced at least 40 m apart. Dune vegetation plays a critical role in dune ecosystems by trapping and stabilizing sand. Areas of the dune that have reduced plant species diversity or lower levels of vegetation coverage are more prone to erosion and provide lower-quality habitat for other taxa. Current municipal regulations can be minimally altered to improve dune vegetation cover and richness while creating minimal inconvenience for beachfront homeowners and visitors."
"Recent high-profile hurricanes have demonstrated the destructiveness of extreme events on coastal landscapes to the world. Barrier islands across the planet are disappearing, exposing vulnerable coastal cities to the damage caused by extreme events. Growing resolve among scientists regarding climate change's connection to tropical cyclones heightens the concern around intensifying extremes and landscape dynamics. This study uses more than 600 Landsat images to examine the role of extreme events on barrier island morphology on three of the Mississippi-Alabama barrier islands from 1972 to 2013. Each island, West Ship Island (WSI), East Ship Island (ESI), and Petit Bois Island (PBI), was measured for area in hectares 14 times per year on average with higher temporal resolution before and after hurricanes, allowing for a high-resolution statistical history of surface area change and the quantification of the impact of extreme weather events. The results reveal that extreme events, specifically hurricanes, mid-latitude cyclones, and thunderstorms, shape the islands more than gradual erosion and accretion processes across all islands. Thunderstorms, winter cyclones, and tropical cyclones each affect the island in different ways, eroding from different areas upon impact. Catastrophic events caused 52-59% of all land area change on the islands during the study period. Hurricanes caused 27-37% of all change across the islands, thunderstorms 11-13%, and mid-latitude cyclones 11-14%. Each of the islands lost at least one-quarter of its 1972-73 areas: WSI 25%, ESI 39%, and PBI 38%. WSI and ESI are both in post-Katrina (2005) regrowth periods, whereas PBI continues to experience net erosion."
"Beach-ridge systems are a common feature of prograding coastlines and they have been recognized as important archives of late Quaternary sea level. In this paper, the combination of Landsat images and shuttle radar topography mission (SRTM) surface model data is shown to provide a solid base to assess gross elevational trends in wide beach-ridge systems. The tilt of a strand plain is a useful first indication to assess possible scenarios of long-term relative sea-level development at new field sites. We identified morphological landscape units for a large and complex coastal lagoon system in NE Patagonia (Argentina) on the basis of a series of Landsat satellite images. A good correlation (R-2 - 0.92) was found for the comparison of high-resolution GPS data with the extracted corresponding SRTM elevations of a 3.8-km-long transect across a wide strand plain. This suggests that the surface model is able to reproduce changes in average elevation between distal and proximal beach-ridge sets at a relatively high accuracy. The SRTM data set is a source of freely available data to approach elevation trends in prograded beach-ridge systems in Quaternary coastal environments. The combination of SRTM data with Landsat images presents a useful tool and source of information for the preparation of fieldwork and detailed surveys as well as for the formulation of working hypotheses in poorly described areas."
"A spatiotemporal cluster analysis of shark-attack rates is applied to identify coastal areas with shark-attack rates that are very high or very low along the North and South Carolina coast. Using a cluster analysis makes it possible to not just pinpoint these areas with more accuracy but also identify where incidents are unlikely to happen. In the past, shark attacks have been studied from a viewpoint of encounter number per region and so limited to the areas in which the attacks occurred. A first look is also taken of the potential influences of some anthropogenic, environmental, and meteorological factors for North and South Carolina in comparison with the better- known attack-prone areas along Florida's coast, to quantify potential causes leading to elevated shark-attack rates, or the lack of them."
"Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) offer a viable alternative to conventional platforms for acquiring high-resolution remote-sensing data at lower cost and increased operational flexibility. UAVs include various configurations of unmanned aircraft, multirotor helicopters (e.g., quadcopters), and balloons/blimps of different sizes and shapes. Quadcopters and balloons fill a gap between satellites and aircraft when a stationary monitoring platform is needed for relatively long-term observation of an area. UAVs have advanced designs to carry small payloads and integrated flight control systems, giving them semiautonomous or fully autonomous flight capabilities. Miniaturized sensors are being developed/adapted for UAV payloads, including hyperspectral imagers, LIDAR, synthetic aperture radar, and thermal infrared sensors. UAVs are now used for a wide range of environmental applications, such as coastal wetland mapping, LIDAR bathymetry, flood and wildfire surveillance, tracking oil spills, urban studies, and Arctic ice investigations."
"Laser Airborne Depth Sounding (LADS) produces high-resolution x, y, z surface data of seafloor topography that permits interpretation of geomorphological features, benthic environments, and habitats, as well as recognition of cultural features and submarine engineering structures. Because the quality of the resulting surface data depends on the type of processing software, it is worthwhile to consider potential improvements of previous bathymetric imagery displays generated from LADS data. A novel method for formatting, gridding, and exporting LADS data into Surfer (R) 12 software is shown to produce enhanced quality surfaces that facilitate shaded relief map analysis. This new Surfer 12 shaded relief map creation procedure intensifies the interpretation of submarine geomorphology from LADS bathymetry images in a GIS platform environment."
"The challenges to coastal regions posed by rising sea levels will differ from community to community. In situ wave and tide time-series data are vital for calibrating numerical coastal models used to predict and mitigate the effects of coastal flooding and high-energy erosive waves and to inform coastal engineering projects. However, for many communities, local, high-quality data sets do not exist. Here, we present a proof-of-concept study for a new method to collect local, low-cost, and high-quality, nearshore hydrographs that can be used to calibrate and test coastal models. In 2011, we deployed self-contained pressure sensors at ocean-and bay-side locations along Wallops Island, Virginia, home of the National Aeronautics and Space Administration Wallops Flight Facility. We used a linear array of data loggers to characterize nearshore wave morphology at two sites along the barrier island beach. During the period of observation, wave height and frequency were both higher along the southern, eroding portion of Wallops Island. We also installed stilling wells in a tidal creek and at the Curtis Merritt Harbor (CMH) on Chincoteague Island to compare tide levels, range, and lag between the back bay and the inlet. Our data show an approximately 1-hour lag between sites, which contrasts with existing forecasted tidal lags in the region that range from 9 minutes to nearly 2 hours. These data loggers are a less-expensive alternative to traditional hydrographic equipment, such as acoustic Doppler current profilers, and can be used in shallow, nearshore environments where buoy-deployed level sensors are impractical. These instruments can be used for specific studies that range in time from a few minutes to a few years; are capable of high-resolution time series (1 Hz); can be installed rapidly as single units or deployed as low-cost, multinode arrays; and can even be used to investigate individual storm events."
"Coastlines form the geometric basis of common GISs. For example, country borders must match the coastline, rivers flow up to the coastline, and a variety of legislation applies up to a defined distance from the coastline. In this article, we propose a well-defined coastline in a structured GIS format that complies with the International Hydrographic Organization (IHO) ocean and sea definitions. Once this line structure has been defined and digitized to an agreed accuracy, it may be used as a building block-for example, for matching river mouths and country borders to the coastline-and for additional functions such as creating a hydrographic coding system. A coding mechanism has been developed based on available mathematical formulas, which enables the rapid computation of similar codes based on any high-quality geometric data. An application of the system is demonstrated in order to assess how grouping and ordering data along a coastline may be explored. Analysis of the coding system also enables an assessment of how coastline length can be compared with data originating from different sources and/or morphology."
"AimLarge ungulate grazers have been a fundamental component of African savannas since the spread of the savanna ecosystem in the Miocene. The magnitude of the impact of ungulates on vegetation has been debated for a long time, but quantifying such effects at the continental scale has been difficult. This study presents an attempt to estimate for the first time the potential impact of large natural ungulate grazer herds on African ecosystems. LocationThe African continent (excluding Madagascar). MethodThe potential impacts of grazing on grass biomass, competition between grasses and trees, the occurrence and effects of wildfire and biome distribution were simulated with a model that couples a physiological grazer population model with a physiological dynamic vegetation one (not including the effects of browsing). This model has previously been shown to reproduce grazer densities across African wildlife reserves. ResultsModelled grazer densities corresponded reasonably well with the continental distribution of African grazers represented by the herbivore functional types in the model. The coupled model predicted a hump-shaped relationship between annual precipitation and grazer biomass densities within a range of estimates from independent studies. In accordance with other studies, net primary productivity and the length of the dry season were the strongest predictors of grazer densities in the model. The inclusion of grazers in the model did not substantially alter an already (without grazers) reasonable fit between simulated vegetation biomass and burned area and estimates of these derived from remote sensing data. Nevertheless, the grazer-vegetation model predicted substantial impacts on grass biomass, tree biomass and burned area, particularly in areas with high grazer densities. The biome distribution at the continental scale, however, was similar with and without grazers. Main conclusionThe results suggest that natural large ungulate grazers have been important drivers of ecosystem functioning in some savanna ecosystems, but also that they do not have a large effect on the continental-scale biome distribution and carbon stocks."
"AimTo evaluate trend analysis of earth observation (EO) dense time series as a new way of describing and mapping changes in ecosystem functioning at regional to global scales. Spatio-temporal patterns of change covering 1982-2011 are discussed in the context of changes in land use and land cover (LULCC). LocationGlobal. MethodsThis study takes advantage of the different phenological cycles of recurrent vegetation (herbaceous vegetation) and persistent vegetation (woody/shrub cover) in combining trend analyses of global-scale vegetation based on different annual/seasonal normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) metrics. Spatial patterns of combined vegetation trends derived from the Global Inventory Modeling and Mapping Studies NDVI are analysed using land-cover information (GLC2000). ResultsThe direction of change in annual and seasonal NDVI metrics is similar for most global terrestrial ecosystems, but areas of diverging trends were also observed for certain regions across the globe. These areas are shown to be dominated by land-cover classes of deciduous forest in tropical/subtropical areas. Areas of observed change are found in dry deciduous forest in South America and central southern Africa and are in accordance with studies of hotspot LULCC areas conducted at local and regional scales. The results show that dense time series of EO data can be used to map large-scale changes in ecosystem functional type that are due to forest cover dynamics, including forest degradation, deforestation/reforestation and bush encroachment. Main conclusionsWe show that areas characterized by changes in ecosystem functioning governed by LULCC at regional and global scales can be mapped from dense time series of global EO data. The patterns of diverging NDVI metric trends can be used as a reference in evaluating the impacts of environmental changes related to LULCC and the approach may be used to detect changes in ecosystem functioning over time."
"AimTo derive location-specific parameters that reflect the geographic differences among cultivars in vernalization requirements, sensitivity to day length (photoperiod) and temperature, which can be used to simulate the phenological development of wheat and maize at the global scale. LocationGlobal. MethodsBased on crop calendar observations and literature describing the large-scale patterns of phenological characteristics of cultivars, we developed algorithms to compute location-specific parameters to represent this large-scale pattern. Vernalization requirements were related to the duration and coldness of winter, sensitivity to day length was assumed to be represented by the minimum and maximum day lengths occurring at a location, and sensitivity to temperature was related to temperature conditions during the vegetative development phase of the crop. ResultsApplication of the derived location-specific parameters resulted in high agreement between simulated and observed lengths of the cropping period. Agreement was especially high for wheat, with mean absolute errors of less than 3 weeks. In the main maize cropping regions, cropping periods were over- and underestimated by 0.5-1.5 months. We also found that interannual variability in simulated wheat harvest dates was more realistic when accounting for photoperiod effects. Main conclusionsThe methodology presented here provides a good basis for modelling the phenological characteristics of cultivars at the global scale. We show that current global patterns of growing season length as described in cropping calendars can be largely reproduced by phenology models if location-specific parameters are derived from temperature and day length indicators. Growing seasons can be modelled more accurately for wheat than for maize, especially in warm regions. Our method for computing parameters for phenology models from temperature and day length offers opportunities to improve the simulation of crop productivity by crop simulation models developed for large spatial areas and for long-term climate impact projections that account for adaptation in the selection of varieties."
"AimIt has been well demonstrated that the large-scale distribution patterns of numerous species are driven by similar macroecological factors. However, understanding of this topic remains limited when applied to our own species. Here we take a large-scale look at ancient agriculturalist populations over the past two millennia. The main aim of this study was to test the hypothesis that the patterns of agriculturalist populations were shaped by relevant macroecological factors. LocationChina. MethodsUsing detailed historical census data, we reconstructed spatial patterns of human population density over 13 imperial dynasties in ancient China, which was dominated by agrarian societies. We used simultaneous autoregressive models to examine the population densities of agriculturalists in relation to climatic, topographic, edaphic and hydrological variables, together with the spatial structure of a concentration of population toward national capitals. The pure and shared effects of these variables and the population-concentration structure were decomposed using a variation partitioning procedure. ResultsSpatial population patterns of ancient agriculturalists can be well modelled by climate, topography, soil properties and local hydrological systems. A plausible explanation is that by influencing crop yield these environmental factors essentially drive the distribution of agriculturalists. The population-concentration structure can also explain agriculturalist patterns to a considerable extent. This structure and those environmental factors have largely shared effects in simultaneously shaping these agriculturalist patterns. Main conclusionsWhile humans can effectively temper environmental constraints at small spatial scales, our results demonstrate that macroecological factors underpin the spatial patterns of humans at large scales. Macroecological constraints and their relative importance are found to be similar for humans and other species, suggesting that similar mechanisms are likely to underlie these macroecological patterns. Our findings have potential implications for the assessment of future responses of humans to global environmental changes."
"AimMovement of water from the land surface to the atmosphere (evapotranspiration, ET) is the dominant output flux in the global terrestrial surface water budget. The partitioning of ET between soil evaporation (E) and plant transpiration (T) couples important ecological, hydrological and atmospheric processes. ET partitioning has been hypothesized to vary as a function of woody plant cover, yet a relationship between ET partitioning and woody cover has not been quantified empirically. Land surface models assume unit increase in T per unit increase in vegetation cover (woody cover), following a proportional linear relationship. Recent assessments have questioned the validity of this assumption for heterogeneous canopies, but we lack experimental data across an explicitly defined gradient of woody cover to characterize this relationship. LocationNorth American monsoon region. MethodsIn a controlled dryland environment experimental facility, we manipulated woody cover and documented the response of ET and its component fluxes. We incorporated the resulting functions into a widely used coupled land-atmosphere model (WRF-Noah) to document the implications of modifying specific model parameters that assume (1:1) proportionality. ResultsAs total ET increased with woody cover, T/ET deviated below 1:1 proportionality. Using our experimentally determined relationship for ET partitioning and woody cover in the model, we observed reductions in ET of as much as 40% during the monsoon season and annual increases of almost 200% in regional E. Main conclusionsOur results highlight a limitation of modelled ET that affects regional to global patterns of water flux, with implications for a number of earth surface processes. A better understanding of how changing woody cover influences patch-scale ecohydrological processes is needed, particularly under current changes in woody cover associated with deforestation, afforestation and drought-induced mortality. More specifically, improved representation of E and T fluxes will improve understanding and modelling of large-scale ecological, hydrological and atmospheric processes."
"AimRegions with a mediterranean climate are among the most species-rich regions in the world. They are also among the regions with the greatest number of non-native invasive species. However, not all introduced species become invasive. Previously, we found that non-native Asteraceae closely related to native species are more likely to establish and spread in California, USA. We conducted reciprocal studies in another mediterranean-climate region with high species richness, the Italian Peninsula. Mediterranean Basin invaders in the Astereae mostly originated in temperate North America, whereas the invasive Cardueae of California are primarily from the Mediterranean Basin. LocationThe Mediterranean Basin (Italy). MethodsUtilizing the first fossil-calibrated molecular phylogenies of the tribe Astereae, we explored the evolutionary patterns among native and non-native taxa within this group. To elucidate the mechanisms driving the observed patterns, we modelled the ecological niches of Astereae species on a global scale and examined correlations between ecological similarity and evolutionary relatedness among taxa. ResultsNot only were invasive taxa highly clustered among natives, they were also more closely related to natives than were non-invasive introduced taxa. We found that invasive species had higher degrees of niche overlap with native species than did non-invasive introduced species. Moreover, pairwise niche distance among species was significantly correlated with evolutionary time, indicating that the ecological niche is phylogenetically conserved. Main conclusionsThe results of our study are consistent with those from our work in California, suggesting that introduced Asteraceae taxa that are closely related to native species are likely to become invasive on both sides of the Atlantic. Furthermore, existing ecological attributes seem to drive these evolutionary patterns. We suggest that potential invaders closely related to natives should be considered as high priorities for management."
"AimUnderstanding the relative contribution of diversification rates (speciation and extinction) and dispersal in the formation of the latitudinal diversity gradient - the decrease in species richness with increasing latitude - is a main goal of biogeography. The mammalian order Carnivora, which comprises 286 species, displays the traditional latitudinal diversity gradient seen in almost all mammalian orders. Yet the processes driving high species richness in the tropics may be fundamentally different in this group from that in other mammalian groups. Indeed, a recent study suggested that in Carnivora, unlike in all other major mammalian orders, net diversification rates are not higher in the tropics than in temperate regions. Our goal was thus to understand the reasons why there are more species of Carnivora in the tropics. LocationWorld-wide. MethodsWe reconstructed the biogeographical history of Carnivora using a time-calibrated phylogeny of the clade comprising all terrestrial species and dispersal-extinction-cladogenesis models. We also analysed a fossil dataset of carnivoran genera to examine how the latitudinal distribution of Carnivora varied through time. ResultsOur biogeographical analyses suggest that Carnivora originated in the East Palaearctic (i.e. Central Asia, China) in the early Palaeogene. Multiple independent lineages dispersed to low latitudes following three main paths: toward Africa, toward India/Southeast Asia and toward South America via the Bering Strait. These dispersal events were probably associated with local extinctions at high latitudes. Fossil data corroborate a high-latitude origin of the group, followed by late dispersal events toward lower latitudes in the Neogene. Main conclusionsUnlike most other mammalian orders, which originated and diversified at low latitudes and dispersed out of the tropics', Carnivora originated at high latitudes, and subsequently dispersed southward. Our study provides an example of combining phylogenetic and fossil data to understand the generation and maintenance of global-scale geographical variations in species richness."
"AimSpatial environmental heterogeneity (EH) is an important driver of species richness, affecting species coexistence, persistence and diversification. EH has been widely studied in ecology and evolution and quantified in many different ways, with a strong bias towards a few common measures of EH like elevation range. Here, we calculate 51 measures of EH within grid cells world-wide across three spatial grains to investigate similarities and differences among these measures. Moreover, we compare the association between species richness of terrestrial mammals and each EH measure to assess the impact of methodological choices on EH-richness relationships found by standard macroecological modelling approaches. LocationGlobal. MethodsWe derive 51 measures of EH from nine variables related to the five subject areas land cover, vegetation, climate, soil and topography, using nine calculation methods. We first explore differences among these EH measures with correlation and principal components analyses. We then analyse the relationship between mammal species richness and each EH measure alone and while accounting for effects of current climate, regional biogeographic history and human influence. We assess the impact of subject area and method of calculation of EH measures on model support using conditional inference trees. ResultsDespite some redundancy, correlations (r(s)=-0.45 to 1.00, median 0.35) and spatial patterns indicate clear differences between the EH measures. We find clear effects of subject area and calculation method on the importance of EH measures for mammal species richness. Measures of climatic and topographic EH and measures calculated as counts and ranges (as against, for example, coefficient of variation) receive particularly high model support across all spatial grains. Main conclusionsThe outcome of broad-scale EH-richness studies is greatly determined by methodological decisions on calculation of measures and statistical analysis. These decisions should therefore be made carefully with regard to the hypothesis and mechanism of interest."
"AimTo compare the fit of models of climate, habitat quality, neutral processes, and geometric constraints to species richness and composition of small mammal assemblages. LocationThe South American Atlantic Forest biome. MethodsUsing neutral models and mid-domain effect models, we simulated species spread in a spatially explicit array of grid cells representing the Atlantic Forest domain. We compared empirical patterns of species richness and composition with predictions of the neutral and mid-domain effect models. We also modeled individual species responses to climatic conditions and forest integrity, a measure of habitat quality. ResultsHabitat quality was the single best predictor of local species richness (-diversity), but was a poor predictor of local species composition and of the decay in species similarity with distance (-diversity). The neutral and mid-domain models generated very similar predictions, and were better predictors of species composition than of species richness. Climate variables were also strongly associated with overall species composition, but not with species richness. Main ConclusionsThe species richness of small-mammal assemblages in the Atlantic Forest is best explained by variation in habitat quality. In contrast, the composition of small-mammal assemblages is best explained by models of limited dispersal (neutral and mid-domain) and effects of climate on local species composition. Collectively, these results suggest that regional patterns of species richness may be uncoupled from patterns of species composition. Both species richness and composition should be considered when evaluating the predictions of neutral and mid-domain effect models, and of correlations of community structure with climatic or habitat variables."
"AimMacroclimate is a major determinant of large-scale diversity patterns. However, the influence of smaller-scale factors on local diversity across large spatial extents is not well documented. Here, we quantify the relative importance of local (patch-scale), landscape-scale and macroclimatic drivers of herbaceous species diversity in small forest patches in agricultural landscapes across Europe. LocationDeciduous forest patches in eight regions along a macroclimatic gradient from southern France to central Sweden and Estonia. MethodsThe diversity of forest specialists and generalists at three levels (whole forest patch, sampling plots within patches and between scales) was related to patch-scale (forest area, age, abiotic and biotic heterogeneity), landscape-scale (amount of forest, grasslands and hedgerows around the patch, patch isolation) and macroclimatic variables (temperature and precipitation) using generalized linear mixed models and variation partitioning for each group of variables. ResultsThe total amount of explained variation in diversity ranged from 8% for plot-scale diversity of generalists to 54% for patch-scale diversity of forest specialists. Patch-scale variables always explained more than 60% of the explained variation in diversity, mainly due to the positive effect of within-patch heterogeneity on patch-scale and between-scale diversities and to the positive effect of patch age on plot-scale diversity of forest specialists. Landscape-scale variables mainly contributed to the amount of explained variation in plot-scale diversity, being more important for forest specialists (21%) than for generalists (18%). Macroclimatic variables contributed a maximum of 11% to the plot-scale diversity of generalists. Main conclusionsMacroclimate poorly predicts local diversity across Europe, and herbaceous diversity is mainly explained by habitat features, less so by landscape structure. We show the importance of conserving old forest patches as refugia for typical forest species, and of enhancing the landscape context around the patches by reducing the degree of disturbance caused by agriculture."
"Ecologists and biogeographers are currently expending great effort forecasting shifts in species geographical ranges that may result from climate change. However, these efforts are problematic because they have mostly relied on presence-only data that ignore within-species genetic diversity. Technological advances in high-throughput sequencing have now made it cost-effective to survey the genetic structure of populations sampled throughout the range of a species. These data can be used to delineate two or more genetic clusters within the species range, and to identify admixtures of individuals within genetic clusters that reflect different patterns of ancestry. Species distribution models (SDMs) applied to the presence and absence of genetic clusters should provide more realistic forecasts of geographical range shifts that take account of genetic variability. High-throughput sequencing and spatially explicit models may be used to further refine these projections."
"Aim(1) To synthesize data on the physical and phylogeographical history of the Mexican highlands, with a focus on the Trans-Mexican Volcanic Belt (TMVB), and (2) to propose approaches and analyses needed for examining the interaction of climate and volcanism. LocationMexico. MethodsWe performed a literature and data survey of the climatic, geological and phylogeographical history of the Mexican highlands. We then assessed how the expected effects of topographic isolation, co-occurring palaeoclimatic fluctuations and volcanism can be tested against the distribution of genetic diversity of high-elevation taxa. ResultsThe Mexican highlands present a complex biogeographical, climatic and geological history. Montane taxa have been exposed to a sky-island dynamic through climate fluctuations, allowing for long-term insitu population persistence, while also promoting recent divergence and speciation events. Volcanic activity transformed part of the Mexican highlands during the Pleistocene, mainly in the TMVB, leading to co-occurring climate and topographical changes. The TMVB highlands provide a suitable template to examine how low-latitude mountains can facilitate both the long-term persistence of biodiversity as well as allopatric and parapatric speciation driven by climatic and geological events. Main conclusionsClimate fluctuations, together with recent volcanism, have driven the diversification and local persistence of biodiversity within the Mexican highlands. The climate-volcanism interaction is challenging to study; however, this can be overcome by coupling genomic data with landscape analyses that integrate the geological and climatic history of the region."
"AimSuture zones are areas where closely related species from different biogeographical regions come into contact and interbreed. This concept originated from the study of terrestrial ecosystems but it remains unclear whether a similar phenomenon occurs in the marine environment. Here we investigate a potential suture zone from a previously unknown hybrid hotspot at the Socotra Archipelago (Yemen), located in the Arabian Sea, where fauna from the Red Sea, Gulf of Aden, Arabian Sea, western Indian Ocean and greater Indo-Polynesian Province intersect. LocationRed Sea, Gulf of Aden, Arabian Sea and Indian Ocean. MethodsPutative hybrid reef fish were identified based on intermediate coloration and morphology. Underwater observations and collections were conducted to determine: (1) whether parent species form heterospecific social groups or breeding pairs; (2) the sex and reproductive status of morphologically intermediate individuals; and (3) whether parent species were forming mixed species associations owing to a dearth of conspecific partners. To support hybrid status, morphologically intermediate and parental individuals were genotyped using mitochondrial DNA cytochrome c oxidase subunit I (COI), nuclear recombination-activating gene 2 (RAG2) and the nuclear TMO-4C4 (TMO) gene. ResultsWe observed putative hybrids involving 14 species from four reef fish families at Socotra. Most cases involved a parental species with a restricted distribution (e.g. Red Sea or Arabian Sea) and a broadly distributed Indo-Pacific species. In most cases, at least one of the parent species was rare at Socotra. Hybrid gene flow was largely unidirectional, and although introgression was rare, we found evidence that some butterflyfish and surgeonfish hybrids were fertile and formed breeding groups with parental species. Main conclusionsThe rate of hybrid discovery at Socotra is much greater than that recorded elsewhere in the marine environment and involved both allopatric and sympatric species. This study highlights the importance of biogeographical location, reef habitat, environmental conditions and abundance disparities at Socotra in potentially facilitating hybridization among reef fishes at the edge of their distribution."
"AimTo combine a time-calibrated phylogeny with distributional, fossil and geomorphological data to infer the patterns of lineage origins and biogeography among gobies. LocationGlobal marine areas (Indo-West Pacific, Western Indian Ocean, Mediterranean, Atlantic and Eastern Pacific) throughout the Cenozoic. MethodsI inferred a molecular phylogeny using beast, simultaneously calibrating nodes for Gobiidae, Gobionellidae and their combined clade. I used that phylogeny, coupled with current range data, to reconstruct historical distributions with the R module BioGeoBEARS under both a dispersal, extinction and cladogenesis (DEC) model and an augmented model including founder effect speciation (DEC+J). I then compared model fits for placing the ancestral node of Gobiidae + Gobiidae at varying reef hotspots throughout the Cenozoic: the West Tethys (Mediterranean), Western Indian Ocean or Indo-West Pacific. ResultsGoby lineages arose over a 12-13 million year period in the late Eocene, followed by repeated invasions of the Eastern Pacific, Atlantic and Mediterranean from an ancestral Indo-West Pacific distribution. Optimization with DEC+J is preferred to DEC, but constraining the root of the phylogeny with a West Tethyan (Mediterranean) or Western Indian Ocean distribution does not result in significantly different model fits under DEC+J. Main conclusionsIn Gobiidae, several lineages migrated through the West Tethys to the Atlantic, followed by extinction in the Mediterranean. In contrast, lineages of Gobionellidae in the Mediterranean did not spread beyond the eastern North Atlantic. Gobionellidae invaded the Eastern Pacific by distinct routes in different lineages, either from the Caribbean through the open Isthmus of Panama or around the northern Pacific Rim. Eastern Pacific Gobiidae are younger and derived from tropical Atlantic clades. Although the reconstructed ancestral area of gobies is the Indo-West Pacific, fossils indicate that gobioids were present in the West Tethys region throughout the Oligocene and Miocene, including taxa that are not known from that area today."
"AimGlacial cycles during the Pleistocene may have frequently contributed to parallel evolution of phenotypes across independently evolving genetic lineages associated with separate glacial refugia. Previous studies based on morphology suggested that the prickly sculpin (Cottus asper) survived the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM) in southern coastal and inland refugia, favouring allopatric divergence between coastal and inland prickling phenotypes, which vary in the degree to which spine-like scales cover the body of the fish. Herein, we aimed to test whether parallel evolution across multiple genetic lineages rather than a single-lineage origin of highly prickled inland sculpins could serve as an explanation for the biogeographical distribution of prickling phenotypes. LocationNorth-western North America, Southeast Alaska and Canada (British Columbia). MethodsWe used data from mitochondrial haplotypes and 19 microsatellite loci to identify distinct genetic lineages as a basis to interpret patterns of phenotypic evolution. ResultsThe occurrence of multiple mtDNA groups suggests that highly prickled inland phenotypes comprise more than one genetic lineage. Both mtDNA and microsatellite data are consistent with post-glacial dispersal along the coast and repeated coastal to inland colonization events, as opposed to inland dispersal of a single lineage from a southern refugium to northern regions. Main conclusionsOur results suggest that highly prickled inland phenotypes evolved repeatedly following multiple inland colonization events, probably via coastal rivers. The prickly sculpin therefore provides an example of recent (post-glacial) parallel evolution, potentially facilitated by standing genetic variation already present in the ancestral coastal populations."
"AimTo understand the evolutionary history and local adaptation of marginal, subtropical populations of a common reef-building coral (genus Pocillopora) and their Symbiodinium endosymbionts. LocationSubtropical coastal (Solitary Islands, Flinders Reef) and offshore (Lord Howe Island, Middleton Reef, Elizabeth Reef) eastern Australia and the southern Great Barrier Reef (GBR). MethodsCoral genetic diversity and identity were assessed by sequence analysis of a mitochondrial (mtDNA) region (ORF), a PCR-based mtDNA screening assay, and microsatellite loci. The identity of the Symbiodinium was determined using denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE) analysis of nuclear rDNA ITS2. ResultsThe mitochondrial haplotype Pocillopora damicornis Type was present at all locations: 100% on the GBR and Flinders Reef, 85% and 87% respectively at Middleton Reef and Elizabeth Reef, 25% at Lord Howe Island and 5% at the Solitary Islands. An additional haplotype was observed at the Solitary Islands (corresponding to the recently described Pocillopora aliciae), and a third haplotype at the offshore high-latitude reefs (termed the Lord Howe Island haplotype). Congruent with the mtDNA results, microsatellite markers showed the same three population clusters. One Symbiodinium profile occurred in 100% of the samples at two of the three GBR reefs and Flinders Reef, and a different profile occurred in all colonies analysed from Lord Howe Island. These two profiles were observed at Middleton and Elizabeth reefs in association with both P. damicornis Type and the Lord Howe Island coral haplotype. Two unique Symbiodinium profiles were detected at the Solitary Islands. Main conclusionsWe detected evidence for local adaptation of subtropical coral and Symbiodinium, flexible coral-Symbiodinium associations, and the presence of transition zones that may contain evolutionarily significant novelty."
"AimOur current understanding of migratory strategies and the reasons for their high variability along the phylogenetic tree remains relatively poor. Most of the hypotheses relating to migration have been formulated for terrestrial taxa; classically, oceanic migrations were considered as merely dispersive because of the scarcity of observations in the open ocean. We describe for the first time, the migration strategy of a small seabird, the Bulwer's petrel (Bulweria bulwerii), and provide new insights into the ecology and evolution of long-distance marine migrations. LocationSubtropical and tropical Atlantic Ocean. MethodsUsing cutting-edge geolocators, we examined the year-round distribution and at-sea activity patterns of adult Bulwer's petrels sampled at five localities throughout the species' breeding range in the Atlantic, within the Azores, Salvages, Canary and Cape Verde archipelagos. We assessed the migratory connectivity of the species and its habitat use at population and metapopulation scales. ResultsOur results provide the first evidence of an oriented leapfrog migration in oceanic seabirds. Ecological niche models based on breeding-season data effectively predicted that subtropical waters of the South Atlantic would be the preferred habitat for the northern populations of Bulwer's petrels during the non-breeding season. Habitat modelling also highlighted similarities in distributions between the breeding and non-breeding periods for the southern populations. Data on at-sea activity patterns suggested that birds from the northern and southern populations behave differently during the breeding season, as well as in the northern and southern non-breeding ranges during the non-breeding period. Main conclusionsThese results indicate that specific habitat preferences, presumably related to differences in prey availability, explain the observed distributions and hence the pattern of leapfrog migration described for Bulwer's petrel. Our study demonstrates the utility of integrating diverse tracking data from multiple populations across international boundaries, and habitat modelling, for identifying important areas common to many marine species in the vast oceanic environments."
"AimMany plants, especially at high latitudes, have both widespread and highly discontinuous geographical distributions. To increase understanding of how such patterns originate, we examine genetic patterns in the arctic-alpine plant Sibbaldia procumbens. We evaluate the contributions of refugia and the role of long-distance dispersal in shaping the current range of this species. LocationNorthern Hemisphere, especially North America. MethodsWe sampled Sibbaldia from 176 localities, including 168 for S. pro-cumbens. We analysed sequence variation in three plastid DNA non-coding regions (the atpI-atpH and trnL-trnF intergenic spacers and the trnL intron), performed Bayesian phylogenetic analyses and statistical parsimony analyses on the combined sequences, and analysed the geographical patterns of haplotype distribution and genetic diversity using data from all populations. ResultsSibbaldia procumbens probably originated in the mountains of South and East Asia. We identified highly distinct clades in Europe and North America, which overlapped on oceanic islands of the North Atlantic indicating long-distance dispersal capability. The North American clade included two lineages, one in California and the other widely distributed across the continent and North Atlantic. Haplotype diversity in the latter lineage was markedly higher to the south, suggesting mid-late Pleistocene southward displacement of North American populations with subsequent migration northwards into previously glaciated regions. In Europe, disjunct geographical regions generally harboured distinct haplotypes. Main conclusionsMultiple Pleistocene refugia for S. procumbens occurred in both North America and Europe. North American refugia existed in California and in the southern Rocky Mountains, but in contrast with most widespread arctic-alpine species we found no evidence for a Beringian refugium. Cryptic refugia may have existed within the Cordilleran Ice Sheet. Episodes of range expansion and contraction and long-distance dispersal have all contributed to the genetic structure and widespread but fragmented distribution of this species."
"AimAccording to the palynological record, rapid plant migrations following the retreat of the last glacier were common in North America and Europe. However, providing an explanation for these rapid migration rates has been challenging considering modern-day seed dispersal distances. We used the newly developed seed dispersal functionality in a hybrid dynamic global vegetation model (DGVM) to simulate two theories that have been proposed to explain rapid plant migrations: long-distance seed dispersal and northern refugial populations. LocationIdealized landscapes representing temperate and boreal regions of North America. MethodsVegetation migration rates for three species (Acer rubrum, Fagus grandifolia and Picea glauca) were simulated in response to climate change across a landscape. All simulations included long-distance seed dispersal; however, we compared landscape colonization rates both with and without the presence of northern refugial populations. ResultsFor all three species, the colonization rates were faster when there was a northern refugial population. Increasing the number of locations of refugia further increased the rate of landscape colonization, and this was most effective when refugial populations were spatially separated. The perceived migration rates (i.e. the time it took to spread the furthest distance away from the southern refugium) were approximately twice as fast when a refugium was present. For example, A.rubrum had a perceived migration rate of 119myr(-1) without refugia and a perceived migration rate of 204myr(-1) with a northern refugium. Main conclusionsThe simulated migration rates that matched the rapid migration rates observed in the pollen record for Acer were only achieved when both long-distance dispersal and northern refugial populations were included in the simulations. Even with refugial populations, migration rates for P.glauca and F.grandifolia were slower than historical rates. The results of this study are consistent with the hypothesis that plant migration rates calculated from the pollen record overestimate the ability of most species to track rapid climate change."
"AimWe used an integrative approach to reconstruct the evolutionary history of the alpine long-eared bat, Plecotus macrobullaris, to test whether the variable effects of Pleistocene climatic oscillations across geographical regions led to contrasting population-level demographic histories within a single species. LocationThe Western Palaearctic. MethodsWe sequenced the complete mitochondrial genomes of 57 individuals from across the distribution of the species. The analysis integrated ecological niche modelling (ENM), approximate Bayesian computation (ABC), measures of genetic diversity and Bayesian phylogenetic methods. ResultsWe identified two deep lineages: a western lineage, restricted to the Pyrenees and the Alps, and an eastern lineage, which expanded across the mountain ranges east of the Dinarides (Croatia). ENM projections of past conditions predicted that climatic suitability was reduced during cold stages in the areas inhabited by the western lineage, while the opposite trend was observed in the mountains inhabited by the eastern lineage. The palaeodemographic scenario that best fitted our data is consistent with the western lineage population size having shrunk repeatedly because of the extensive glaciation events that occurred in the Alps and Pyrenees during the Pleistocene. In contrast, the eastern lineage maintained a constant population size as is consistent with more limited glaciation in the mountains of south-eastern Europe and the Middle East. Main conclusionsThis study shows that the demographic response of populations to Pleistocene climatic oscillations depended on their geographical location, offering an example of population-level variations in the effects and long-term consequences of climate change."
"AimWe examined contemporary genetic structure of brown bears (Ursus arctos) in a recently deglaciated landscape to identify the number and geographical range of populations, the level of admixture, landscape features that limit or promote genetic connectivity, and probable population sources of bears in Glacier Bay following the end of the Little Ice Age (LIA). We sought to determine whether brown bears exhibit genetic structure corresponding with landscape features and whether source populations of recent colonizers could be determined using nuclear genetic markers. LocationSoutheast Alaska is composed of many islands, fjords and ice-covered lands with a complex history of changing glaciation and sea level throughout the Pleistocene and into the Holocene. Glacier Bay was again covered by ice during the LIA until c. 260years ago when rapid retreat began exposing land for colonization. MethodsWe used DNA microsatellites to examine the genetic diversity of 105 brown bears. We identified the number of genetically distinct populations and the degree of admixture using Bayesian allele frequency assignment tests, determined colonizing population sources based on fixation and differentiation indices, and tested correlations between the genetic relatedness and a suite of landscape models. ResultsThe shoreline of Glacier Bay hosts brown bears from at least two distinct genetic populations which may represent contemporary colonizing sources. There is also indication of a third group specific to Glacier Bay that may represent a historical colonizing population. The three genetic populations overlap in northern Glacier Bay, with relatively low admixture between the populations, indicating current immigration. Main conclusionsGlacier Bay fjord inhibits dispersal and funnels recolonizing bears from east and west refugia in a northward direction. At the northern end of Glacier Bay these populations are currently coming into secondary contact after hundreds and possibly thousands of years of separation, creating a population-level biological contact zone."
"AimWe tested the influence of Pleistocene climatic fluctuations and the potential effect of future climate change on Southeast Asian small mammal distributions using two forest-dwelling (Leopoldamys herberti and Leopoldamys sabanus) and one karst (Leopoldamys neilli) endemic rodent species as models. LocationSoutheast Asia. MethodsWe used presence-absence data of genetically identified individuals, bioclimatic variables and species distribution modelling techniques to predict potential distributions of the three studied species under current, past [Last Interglacial (LIG) and Last Glacial Maximum (LGM)] and future conditions. We applied a variety of modelling techniques and then used consensus techniques to draw up robust maps of potential distribution ranges at all stages. ResultsAccording to our models, these three Leopoldamys species did not experience significant range contraction during the LGM. Our models revealed substantial range contraction during the LIG for L. herberti in northern Indochina, while its distribution expanded in southern Indochina. Evidence of a southward range expansion during that period was also obtained for L. neilli, whereas L. sabanus remained widely distributed in insular Southeast Asia but experienced a range contraction on the Thai-Malay Peninsula. The two future climate change scenarios used predicted that large climatically suitable areas would still be available in the future for the three species. Main conclusionsOur model predictions contradict the well-established hypothesis that Southeast Asian forest-dwelling species were confined to small refugia during the LGM. Moreover, our results suggest that some Southeast Asian taxa may have been distributed in their refugial state during the LIG rather than the LGM. This could be because of vegetation changes that may have occurred at that time as a result of the increased seasonality observed during the LIG. These Pleistocene refugia may have been localized in northern Indochina but our study also revealed that southern Indochina could provide major potential refugia."
"AimA striking case of mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) introgression occurs in the Iberian Peninsula: the mtDNA of Lepus timidus, a species that inhabited this territory during the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM), is almost fixed in the Iberian range of Lepus europaeus, is very frequent in the northern half of Iberia within Lepus granatensis, and is fixed in Lepus castroviejoi. Here, we used a transdisciplinary approach to understand the ecological drivers of the distribution of this introgressed mtDNA in the Iberian hare species. LocationEurope, with an emphasis on the Iberian Peninsula. MethodsFirst, we modelled the climatic niche of L. timidus to predict the favourability for the species during the LGM. Second, we gathered data regarding L. timidus mtDNA introgression for 1137 individuals (139 populations) from the Iberian Peninsula. We tested whether the climatic favourability for L. timidus during the LGM reflects the frequency of the introgressed mtDNA in the carrier hare populations. ResultsThe climatic favourability for the LGM is positively related to the presence of individuals with L. timidus mtDNA, and discriminates better than by chance between individuals with and without this lineage. At the population level, the favourability values relate to the observed frequencies of mtDNA introgression and discriminate between populations with and without L. timidus mtDNA. Main conclusionsThe results suggest that the geographical distribution of L. timidus mtDNA introgression is linked to L. timidus distribution in Iberia during the LGM. Our study helps to improve our understanding of the role of climate in the reticulated evolutionary history of hares, and is a first step towards understanding the ecological impact of mtDNA introgression on Iberian hares."
"AimStudies of fire activity along environmental gradients have been undertaken, but the results of such studies have yet to be integrated with fire-regime analysis. We characterize fire-regime components along climate gradients and a gradient of human influence. LocationWe focus on a climatically diverse region of north-western North America extending from northern British Columbia, Canada, to northern Utah and Colorado, USA. MethodsWe used a multivariate framework to collapse 12 climatic variables into two major climate gradients and binned them into 73 discrete climate domains. We examined variation in fire-regime components (frequency, size, severity, seasonality and cause) across climate domains. Fire-regime attributes were compiled from existing databases and Landsat imagery for 1897 large fires. Relationships among the fire-regime components, climate gradients and human influence were examined through bivariate regressions. The unique contribution of human influence was also assessed. ResultsA primary climate gradient of temperature and summer precipitation and a secondary gradient of continentality and winter precipitation in the study area were identified. Fire occupied a distinct central region of such climate space, within which fire-regime components varied considerably. We identified significant interrelations between fire-regime components of fire size, frequency, burn severity and cause. The influence of humans was apparent in patterns of burn severity and ignition cause. Main conclusionsWildfire activity is highest where thermal and moisture gradients converge to promote fuel production, flammability and ignitions. Having linked fire-regime components to large-scale climate gradients, we show that fire regimes - like the climate that controls them - are a part of a continuum, expanding on models of varying constraints on fire activity. The observed relationships between fire-regime components, together with the distinct role of climatic and human influences, generate variation in biotic communities. Thus, future changes to climate may lead to ecological changes through altered fire regimes."
"AimWe investigated how the probability of burning is influenced by the time since fire (TSF) and gradients of climate, soil and vegetation in the fire-prone mediterranean-climate mallee woodlands of south-eastern Australia. This provided insight into the processes controlling contemporary fuel dynamics and fire regimes across biogeographical boundaries, and the consequent effects of climate change on potential shifts in boundaries between fuel systems and fire regimes, at a subcontinental scale. LocationSouth-eastern Australia. MethodsA desktop-based GIS was used to generate random sampling points across the study region to collect data on intersecting fire interval, rainfall, vegetation and soil type. We used a Bayesian framework to examine the effects of combinations of rainfall, vegetation and soil type on the hazard-of-burning and survival parameters of the Weibull distribution. These analyses identify the nature of environmental controls on the length of fire intervals and the age-dependence of the hazard of burning. ResultsHigher rainfall was consistently associated with shorter fire intervals. Within a single level of rainfall, however, the interaction between soil and vegetation type influenced the length of fire intervals. Higher-fertility sands were associated with shorter fire intervals in grass-dominated communities, whereas lower-fertility sands were associated with shorter fire intervals in shrub-dominated communities. The hazard of burning remained largely independent of TSF across the region, only markedly increasing with TSF in shrub-dominated communities at high rainfall. Main conclusionsRainfall had a dominant influence on fire frequency in the mediterranean-climate mallee woodlands of south-eastern Australia. Predicted changes in the spatial distribution and amount of rainfall therefore have the potential to drive changes in fire regimes, although the effects of soil fertility and rainfall on fire regimes do not align on a simple productivity gradient. Reduced soil fertility may favour plant traits that increase the rate of woody litter fuel accumulation and flammability, which may alter the overriding influence of rainfall gradients on fire regimes."
"AimComparative biogeographers question the extent to which codistributed species respond similarly to environmental change. Such responses should create similar, appropriately timed patterns of cladogenesis among codistributed taxa compared to evolutionary independence, which may limit the predictions that can be made for unstudied species. Here, we compare phylogeographical patterns across ecologically divergent, codistributed taxa in the light of New Zealand's palaeohistory. LocationNorth Island, New Zealand. MethodsMitochondrial DNA from six codistributed cicada species (Kikihia ochrina, K.cutora, K.laneorum, K.cauta, K.scutellaris and K.dugdalei) was analysed using phylogenetic methods and molecular dating techniques. We analysed phylogeographical distributions using analysis of molecular variance (AMOVA) to determine the significance of hypothesized biogeographical boundaries for clade differentiation and spatial distribution of genetic diversity. ResultsFive species (Kikihia ochrina, K.cutora, K.laneorum, K.cauta and K.scutellaris) show various degrees of intraspecific concordance with biogeographical boundaries found in previously studied taxa - the Kauri Line, the Northland Line and the newly identified Cockayne's Line. Clade splits of forest species correlate with the Kauri Line and/or Northland Line, whereas splits of scrub/hill species correlate with Cockayne's Line. Four species (Kikihia ochrina, K.cutora, K.laneorum and K.cauta) diversified before the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM, 20ka), whereas two species (K.scutellaris and K.dugdalei) show only post-LGM diversification. Main conclusionsDespite species idiosyncrasies, we see the imprint of shared palaeoclimatic/geological events. We distinguish between (1) the importance of biogeographical lines as the demarcation between older genetically diverse and newer genetically depauperate populations, and (2) the importance of lines as biogeographical boundaries between sister clades. We also stress the importance of dating clade splits to ensure consistency with explanations for the biogeographical lines in question. We suggest that the Taupo Line has been overemphasized as a biogeographical boundary, whereas the importance of the mountain axis running north-east to south-west (Cockayne's Line') has been overlooked."
"AimBeta diversity describes the variation in species composition between sites and can be used to infer why different species occupy different parts of the globe. It can be viewed in a number of ways. First, it can be partitioned into two distinct patterns: turnover and nestedness. Second, it can be investigated from either a species identity or a functional-trait point of view. We aim to document for the first time how these two aspects of beta diversity vary in response to a large environmental gradient. LocationMaloti-Drakensberg Mountains, southern Africa. MethodsWe sampled ant assemblages along an extensive elevational gradient (900-3000m a.s.l.) twice yearly for 7years, and collected functional-trait information related to the species' dietary and habitat-structure preferences. We used recently developed methods to partition species and functional beta diversity into their turnover and nestedness components. A series of null models were used to test whether the observed beta diversity patterns differed from random expectations. ResultsSpecies beta diversity was driven by turnover, but functional beta diversity was composed of both turnover and nestedness patterns at different parts of the gradient. Null models revealed that deterministic processes were likely to be responsible for the species patterns but that the functional changes were indistinguishable from stochasticity. Main conclusionsDifferent ant species are found with increasing elevation, but they tend to represent an increasingly nested subset of the available functional strategies. This finding is unique and narrows down the list of possible factors that control ant existence across elevation. We conclude that diet and habitat preferences have little role in structuring ant assemblages in montane environments and that some other factor must be driving the non-random patterns of species turnover. This finding also highlights the importance of distinguishing between different kinds of beta diversity."
"AimTo evaluate three phylogeographical models associated with the presence of mountains (montane vicariance, sky island and parapatry) as drivers of intraspecific diversification in the sandhill skipper, Polites sabuleti (Lepidoptera: Hesperiidae), a morphologically variable species found in a variety of habitats from sea level to the alpine zone. LocationWestern North America. MethodsThe mitochondrial cytochrome c oxidase subunit II region was sequenced in 189 P.sabuleti individuals. Mitochondrial sequences were used in a spatial analysis of molecular variance (SAMOVA) to evaluate geographical population structure. AFLP markers were also generated for 347 individuals in order to estimate admixture proportions and examine population differentiation based on the nuclear genome. ResultsTwenty-five mitochondrial haplotypes and 42 anonymous AFLP loci were found across 36 collection localities. Mitochondrial variation suggests a degree of regional population structure, although at least one of the inferred population groups extends over nearly the entire geographical range of the species. Analyses of nuclear data (AFLPs) identified five genetic clusters, including one restricted to high elevations in the Sierra Nevada. Main conclusionsThe distribution of genetic variation within Polites sabuleti, a species with a broad elevational range, does not strictly support either mountain-associated vicariance or sky island' isolation as the dominant process. Instead, we find complex population structure, including evidence for divergence between high- and low-elevation populations in the Sierra Nevada mountains."
"Land cover change is one of the most important drivers of forest ecosystem change. The Hindu Mush Himalayan region (HKH) has experienced severe forest degradation but data and documentation are limited. We undertook this study in the Nepalese part of the Kailash Sacred Landscape (KSL), an important transboundary region known for its biodiversity and the scared values. Forest is an important ecosystem within the landscape and provides various goods and services including habitat for many keystone species. However, precise information on forest change and overall land cover change in the area is limited. We analyzed land cover change and forest fragmentation between 1990 and 2009, and the predicted change for 2030. There was a 9% decrease in forest cover and 12% increase in cropland between 1990 and 2009. A further 4% decline in forest cover and 5% increase in cropland was predicted by 2030, together with a slight increase in grassland and barren area. Fragmentation analysis showed a 10% decrease in large core forest between 1990 and 2009, accompanied by an increase in patch forest. A further 10.6% decline in core forest was predicted by 2030, accompanied by an increase in patch, perforated, small-sized core, and mediumsized core areas. The study suggests that expansions of cropland coupled with high dependency on forests are the major drivers of the observed forest change. Recommendations are made based on the results of the study that will help to maintain and restore forest, and support biodiversity conservation and livelihoods. (C) 2015 The Authors.

"Fine-scale landscape features such as scattered trees are increasingly thought to be critical for dispersal, and need to be considered in connectivity modelling and planning. Yet existing modelling approaches struggle to adequately take fine-scale features and threshold dynamics of dispersal behaviour into account, in part because of computational limitations. We present a framework for modelling connectivity at fine spatial resolutions over large spatial extents. Our framework involves a novel approach to characterising fine-scale dispersal behaviour within the context of existing modelling methods, and uses key parameters of dispersal behaviour to link models and their interpretation at multiple scales. We address computational limitations by creating a gap-crossing threshold layer, which identifies areas where dispersal is possible because of the presence and spacing of fine-scale connectivity elements. This layer is combined with a dispersal-cost layer within a graph-network analysis to identify the optimal least-cost path between patches. Graph metrics are used to assess the importance of specific patches at the regional-scale and to describe connectivity for the whole landscape. A local-scale connectivity model using the Circuitscape software complements the regional analysis outputs by considering all possible pathways across a landscape simultaneously rather than a single least-cost path. The framework was designed specifically to be applied by land use planners who need to quantify the impacts of property development on fine-scale connectivity, yet need to assess implications at the regional scale. We demonstrate the framework by applying it in the Lower Hunter region, Australia. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved."
"The hedonic pricing approach has been successfully applied to estimate the economic value of environmental amenities in urban settings, but the results for landscape variables remain relatively inconsistent across studies. Here, we use national-level data and an existing typology of communities to examine how land use and environmental amenities and disamenities affect rental prices across urban, suburban, periurban, and affluent communities in Switzerland. To make the analysis and the results as transparent as possible we examine largely a priori model specifications, and we systematically report and discuss the patterns of correlation among explanatory variables. Two-level models show that about 70 percent of the price variation is found at the apartment level and about 30 percent at the community level. Models for the different community types suggest that, although we include a sophisticated variable for central services, the centrality of location is not fully controlled in our models and thus picked up by correlated peripheral and central amenities such as open space, forest or urban parks. Analysis of these correlations allows us to qualify our results and present a revised set of relatively reliable estimates. Positive effects on rental prices are identified for views, various types of recreational infrastructure and vicinity of lakes, wetlands, undisturbed areas, nationally significant landscapes and cultural sites. Negative effects are found for several disamenities including road noise, railway noise, industries and power lines. We suggest that systematic hypothesis testing and reporting of correlations may contribute to consistent explanatory patterns in hedonic pricing estimates for landscape amenities.

"Several concepts of landscape modification, landscape naturalness and hemeroby have been put forward to quantify the extent of human activities and impact on landscapes. However, despite numerous studies on the human influence on landscapes, the relationship between these concepts and biodiversity has rarely been tested. On a grid of 1386 lat/long cells (landscape units, c. 30 km(2)) we used simple information on land cover and easily measurable landscape metrics to identify a gradient of landscape modification for the model region of Lower Saxony, Germany. We linked the gradient of landscape modification intensity to richness patterns of eight groups of vascular plants that were aggregated using residence and threat status and habitat preferences of the species. Using k-means cluster analysis a gradient of six landscape modification levels ranging from highly-fragmented urban landscapes to little-fragmented landscapes with large proportions of forest was followed. Richness of the eight species groups considered in the analysis differed significantly along the gradient. For the total and native species pools, for forest, low-nutrient indicating and threatened plants richness peaked at both ends of the modification intensity gradient. For neophytes, urban plants and high-nutrient indicators, richness decreased along the gradient from urbanised to less modified landscapes. Due to its simplicity and coarse scale, our approach may easily be applied to other study areas without comprehensive data on land cover. Furthermore, following proper interpretation by experts, it can be used to identify and preselect priority landscapes for nature conservation planning. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved."
"Planting of woody species is a commonly used method to restore road embankments. Given the importance of road verges as potential corridors and refuge for biodiversity, natural plant regeneration processes may also play an important role in establishing vegetation into these novel landscape elements. Most studies on woody colonization of roadsides have considered only a few sites covering a very limited environmental range. Therefore, it is unclear whether or not there are general patterns that may explain the development of woody vegetation. We analyzed woody vegetation colonization in embankments over a large and heterogeneous territory, using aerial photographs, available repositories of environmental and land management data sets and some embankment features. We addressed the following questions: (1) To what extent does the presence of planted woody plants influence patterns of natural recruitment in road embankments? and (2) What are the key factors underlying natural/passive plant colonization in road embankments? We used Multi-Model Inference (MMI) analysis to model woody vegetation cover. According to our results, woody-planted vegetation does not have a facilitating effect on natural colonization, questioning the efficiency of reforestation measures in the ecological integration of areas affected by road construction. Passive natural plant colonization occurs spontaneously in road verges and shows a highly site-dependent pattern, driven mainly by the age of embankments and the immediate surrounding vegetation. Therefore, we suggest that natural succession may be sufficiently effective as a passive restoration measure on embankments in the long term. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved."
"Strategic approaches to biodiversity conservation increasingly emphasise the restoration of ecological connectivity at landscape scales. However, understanding where these connecting elements should be placed in the landscape is critical if they are to provide both value for money and for biodiversity. For such planning to be effective, it is necessary to have information of the distributions of multiple taxa, however, this is of poor quality for many taxa. We show that sparse, non-systematically collected biological records can be modelled using readily available environmental variables to meaningfully predict potential biodiversity richness, including rare and threatened species, across a landscape. Using a large database of ad-hoc biological records (50 501 records of 502 species) we modelled the richness of wetland biodiversity across the Fens, a formerly extensive wetland, now agricultural landscape in eastern England. We used these models to predict those parts of the agricultural ditch network of greatest potential conservation value and compared this to current strategic network planning. Odonata distribution differed to that of other groups, indicating that single taxon groups may not be effective proxies for other priority biodiversity. Our results challenged previous assumptions that river channels should comprise the main connecting elements in the Fens region. Rather, areas of high ditch density close to a main river are likely to be of greater value and should be targeted for enhancement. This approach can be adopted elsewhere in order to improve the evidence-base for strategic networks plans, increasing their value for money. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved."
"Does expertise in landscape related issues influence the way landscapes are observed? In an eye tracking experiment 21 landscape experts and 21 laymen were asked to observe 74 landscape photographs, each for 10 s. Experts seemed to make significantly more fixations and saccades, had a longer scan path and a larger visual span than the laymen. As a consequence, in the same amount of time, experts visually explored the landscape photographs to a wider extent and in a more global and holistic fashion. This is probably due to the presence of expertise, which seemed to enhance efficient information extraction, enabling experts to interpret and understand the landscapes more easily. In contrast, the laymen's visual exploration of the landscapes was considerably more restricted as they spent significantly more time and attention to singular objects, in particular to buildings. This behaviour may be a result of the lack of expertise, which makes longer fixation times necessary to understand the meaning of the composing landscape elements. A slower information processing leaves less time to visually explore the landscape photograph and hampers laymen to observe the landscape as a whole. Consequently, experts and laymen may not perceive the same features in a landscape and might not even see the same landscape. This conclusion is important for participatory landscape management in which experts and laymen are asked to visually assess landscapes. The often diverging assessments of both groups could partially be explained by their literally different view on landscapes, on which their judgement is based. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

"This study aims to investigate relationships between soundscapes and landscapes within various functions of space, and to examine the influence of functional aspects of places on soundscape perceptions in urban environments. Surveys were conducted to assess soundscape and landscape perceptions in 25 locations in Seoul. Urban contexts were classified into four categories based on main functions, activities, and visual properties of the spaces: commercial, residential, business and recreational. A structural equation model of urban soundscape was constructed using seven factors, namely sound sources (traffic, human, and natural), pleasantness and eventfulness, visual quality, and the harmony of the environment. The model appropriately fit the data measured in the survey. The results showed that dominant factors affecting soundscapes differed in accordance with the main functions of the place. In commercial areas, sounds from human activities played a significant role in evaluating soundscapes. For residential and business functional areas, traffic noise was a dominant sound source influencing the soundscape quality. In addition, human sounds from leisure activities played an important role in constructing a relevant soundscape in urban recreational areas. The findings of this study provide an empirical evidence for understanding the holistic relationships among soundscape factors in urban contexts and demonstrate that functions of place should be taken into consideration as an important context for soundscape design.

"Demographic shifts result in not only urban sprawl but also urban decay. Although urban vacant land is a sign of economic decline, it is beneficial to the improvement of urban ecology since it provides a variety of critical ecosystem services. It is unclear how socioeconomic/ecological drivers collectively affect the emergence and dynamics of vacant land within the urban context of population decrease and economic decline in different shrinking cities. To address this issue, this research performed comprehensive analyses to examine and quantify the impacts of social processes, economic conditions, urban ecological and spatial proximity factors on residential vacant land at both the block group level and the parcel level through incorporating high spatial resolution multispectral aerial photographs and GIS datasets. Results indicate three major conclusions. First, the mean lot NDVI is found to be a consistently effective measurement of residential landscape management behaviors at both levels, which is significantly and positively related to residential vacancy. Second, proximity factors indirectly and partially characterize a number of socioeconomic variables. Third, a ratio index called neighborhood vacancy prevalence was proposed to capture the neighborhood blight effect, and a potentially optimal neighborhood size was obtained among different neighborhood radii. By considering different categories of variables, residential vacancy can be explained and modeled adequately at both the aggregate and fine levels. Urban planners, geographers and social scientists could benefit from the explanatory and predictive model at the fine scale to yield the most updated parcel data with acceptable estimation accuracy for various practical applications.

"The aim of this study is to classify the soundscape characteristics in urban parks based on perceptions of acoustic environments and to examine useful acoustic indicators to identify soundscape classifications. Both acoustic measurements and subjective evaluations of the soundscape were conducted at various locations in three urban parks. Using hierarchical cluster analysis (HCA), the soundscape perceptions in urban parks were classified into three clusters characterized by the dominance of sound sources, such as traffic noise, natural and human-made sounds. Both discriminant function analysis (DFA) and artificial neural network (ANN) analysis were performed using various acoustic parameters to discern which of them best differentiate the soundscape classifications in urban parks. It was found that the indicators representing sound strength (L-Aeq), perceived pitch sensation (tau(1)) and strength of the pitch components (Phi(1)) of sound scenes could effectively identify the clusters. In particular, autocorrelation function (ACF) parameters tau(1) and Phi(1) were significantly correlated with identification of traffic noise and human sounds. It was revealed that sounds caused by various human activities in parks play an important role to influence eventfulness of soundscape perception. Soundscape perceptions were also closely correlated with esthetic quality, simplicity and sense of enclosure of landscape. Despite the fact that the results might be limited to the local conditions in Seoul, the findings could provide useful information for designing appropriate soundscapes in urban parks.

"As an increasing proportion of the global human population resides in urban areas, urban forests are becoming both more important and more threatened. In many cities urban tree cover conflicts with strategies for urban intensification, and is being reduced due to inadequate protection. Here, we assess the effectiveness of one type of tree protection policy used by a number of cities worldwide: the case-by-case protection of specific individual trees. We use Auckland, New Zealand as a case study, where the main form of urban tree protection is now through Auckland Council's Schedule of Notable Trees. We investigated: (1) the species composition of the listed trees, and (2) the relative contribution of geographical variables (suburb age, dwelling density, socio-economic deprivation, and tree cover) in explaining spatial variation in listed-tree density. Tree cover (>8 m) in central Auckland was 6% of the land area, 63.2% of which was on private land. Of these trees, approximately 15% were protected. The tree species protected reflected cultural heritage; popular species were protected in large numbers, whilst only a single individual of a threatened native species was protected. The highest numbers of listed trees were in older suburbs, those with higher density housing, and those with lower levels of socioeconomic deprivation. A low correlation between vegetation cover and listed-tree density shows that the proportion of trees protected varies substantially in different areas. We conclude that this case-by-case tree protection strategy provides insufficient protection for Auckland's urban biodiversity, but better implementation would improve biodiversity and social outcomes.

"The Chilean water model has been described as a textbook example of a free-market water system. This article contributes to the critiques of this model by showing the effect of its implementation in the Atacameno community of Chiu-Chiu, located in the Atacama Desert in the south-central Andes. In this community, the privatization of water rights ignored local water management practices that had produced a high-altitude wetland (known as a vega). This led to the inhabitants' dispossession of crucial water rights and to wetland degradation. This process belies statements that the Chilean model relies on an unregulated market and instead highlights the state's role in marginalizing local irrigation practices by reducing the water consumption of the indigenous population while keeping the copper mining industry (the main source of Chilean income) and related growing urban populations supplied with water."
"Reference evapotranspiration (ETo) is often calculated using the Penman-Monteith (FAO 56 PM; Allen et al 1998) method, which requires data on temperature, relative humidity, wind speed, and solar radiation. But in highmountain environments, such as the Andean paramo, meteorological monitoring is limited and high-quality data are scarce. Therefore, the FAO 56 PM equation can be applied only through the use of an alternative method suggested by the same authors that substitutes estimates for missing data. This study evaluated whether the FAO 56 PM method for estimating missing data can be effectively used for paramo landscapes in the high Andes of southern Ecuador. Our investigation was based on data from 2 automatic weather stations at elevations of 3780 m and 3979 m. We found that using estimated wind speed data has no major effect on calculated ETo but that if solar radiation data are estimated, ETo calculations may be erroneous by as much as 24%; if relative humidity data are estimated, the error may be as high as 14%; and if all data except temperature are estimated, errors higher than 30% may result. Our study demonstrates the importance of using highquality meteorological data for calculating ETo in the wet paramo landscapes of southern Ecuador."
"Tropical mountain regions contain the main headwaters of important rivers in Central America. We selected 2 contrasting catchments located in a mountainous region to evaluate the precision of daily flow estimates based on the Hydrological Land Use Change (HYLUC) and Nedbor-Afstromnings Model (NAM) hydrological models. A second objective was to simulate the impact of expected climate change for the year 2050 on stream flows and seasonal distribution of rainfall. We studied the catchments of the Tempisquito and Cucaracho streams, located in the Guanacaste volcanic mountain range of Costa Rica, from April 2008 to October 2010. Modeling of discharge using the NAM and HYLUC models suggested difficulties in their calibration due to intrinsic catchment characteristics because of their volcanic origin. The climate change scenario applied in both catchments depicted a strong reduction in discharge. However, the Cucaracho catchment, on the Caribbean slope, is predicted to experience a smaller reduction in discharge than the Tempisquito catchment, located on the Pacific slope."
"The Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) can usually be used as a good proxy for evaluating potential variability in regional ecosystems and under climate change. We used 16-day MODIS-NDVI composite satellite data with 250-m resolution for the period 2000 to 2013 to assess the temporal and spatial variation of the NDVI among different alpine grassland classes and groups in northern Tibet. The annual average NDVI of the whole alpine grassland area in northern Tibet generally increased slightly from 2000 to 2003, and the annual average NDVI values ranged from 0.112 to 0.492 across all alpine grassland groups and years. The NDVI clearly decreased from the southeastern to the northwestern areas, with 22.50% of total grasslands significantly having increased or decreased, while 77.50% presented little change during 2000-2013. Both temperature and precipitation were key factors that controlled the NDVI variations of the entire alpine grassland. However, for different alpine grassland classes and groups, the NDVI displayed different correlation patterns with temperature and precipitation. Our results demonstrate that the NDVI variations of alpine grassland generally increased slightly but differed among different classes and groups. Although temperature and precipitation were the driving forces influencing the NDVI of the entire alpine grassland, it was more difficult to define the driving forces for the individual classes and groups, and more detailed analyses covering prolonged observation periods are still needed."
"Satellite imagery has proven extremely useful for repetitive timeline-based data collection, because it offers a synoptic view and enables fast processing of large quantities of data. The changes in tree crown number and land cover in a very remote watershed (area 1305 ha) in Nepal were analyzed using a QuickBird image from 2006 and an IKONOS image from 2011. A geographic object-based image analysis (GEOBIA) was carried out using the region-growing technique for tree crown detection, delineation, and change assessment, and a multiresolution technique was used for land cover mapping and change analysis. The coefficient of determination for tree crown detection and delineation was 0.97 for QuickBird and 0.99 for IKONOS, calculated using a line-intercept transect method with 10 randomly selected windows (131 ha). The number of tree crowns decreased from 47,121 in 2006 to 41,689 in 2011, a loss of approximately 90 trees per month on average; the area of needle-leaved forest was reduced by 140 ha (23%) over the same period. Analysis of widely available very-high-resolution satellite images using GEOBIA techniques offers a cost-effective method for detecting changes in tree crown number and land cover in remote mountain valleys; the results provide the information needed to support improved local-level planning and forest management in such areas."
"Approximately 211 million people live in the Hindu Kush-Himalaya region. Although poverty levels in this region are high, there is a lack of cohesive information on the socioeconomic status of its populations that would enable decision-makers to understand different manifestations of poverty and design effective poverty alleviation programs. Hence, the International Centre for Integrated Mountain Development (ICIMOD), in consultation with international and regional partners, has developed the Multidimensional Poverty Measure for the Hindu Kush-Himalayas (MPM-HKH). This measure aims to identify and describe poor and vulnerable households across the Hindu Kush-Himalaya region-which is predominantly rural and mountainous and covers several of the world's least developed countries-in a consistent manner. This article documents how the MPM-HKH was developed and demonstrates the utility of this approach, using Nepal as an example, by analyzing household survey data from 23 districts. The analysis gives important clues about differences in the intensity and composition of multidimensional poverty across these locations, which highlights the need for location-specific poverty alleviation strategies. The findings should help decision-makers to identify areas of intervention and choose the best measures to reduce poverty."
"Governance collaborations between public and private partners are increasingly used to promote sustainable mountain development, yet information is limited on their nature and precise extent. This article analyzes collaboration on environment and natural resource management in Swedish mountain communities to critically assess the kinds of issues these efforts address, how they evolve, who leads them, and what functional patterns they exhibit based on Margerum's (2008) typology of action, organizational, and policy collaboration. Based on official documents, interviews, and the records of 245 collaborative projects, we explore the role of the state, how perceptions of policy failure may inspire collaboration, and the opportunities that European Union funds have created. Bottom-up collaborations, most of which are relatively recent, usually have an action and sometimes an organizational function. Top-down collaborations, however, are usually organizational or policy oriented. Our findings suggest that top-down and bottom-up collaborations are complementary in situations with considerable conflict over time and where public policies have partly failed, such as for nature protection and reindeer grazing. In less contested areas, such as rural development, improving tracks and access, recreation, and fishing, there is more bottom-up, action-oriented collaboration. State support, especially in the form of funding, is central to explaining the emergence of bottom-up action collaboration. Our findings show that the state both initiates and coordinates policy networks and retains a great deal of power over the nature and functioning of collaborative governance. A practical consequence is that there is great overlap-aggravated by sectorized approaches-that creates a heavy workload for some regional partners."
"As many of the world's poor and food-insecure people live in mountain regions, sustainable mountain development is an important part of the work of the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) of the United Nations (UN). Over the years, FAO has played the leading role in sustainable mountain development within the UN system; it was appointed task manager for chapter 13 of agenda 21 in 1992 and acted as the lead agency for the International Year of Mountains in 2002. From 2003 onward, FAO was also mandated by the UN General Assembly to lead the annual observance of International Mountain Day on 11 December. Every 2 years, FAO prepares the secretary general's report to the UN General Assembly, which describes the status and progress of sustainable mountain development at the national and international levels and provides suggestions for consideration by the Assembly. FAO is a member of the Mountain Partnership and hosts its secretariat. This review of the latest actions of FAO's program on sustainable mountain development, watershed management, and forest hydrology- which includes normative work, field activities, and support to international processes- updates our previous statement (Manuelli et al, 2014) and summarizes the latest achievements of the Mountain Partnership."

"Chinstrap penguins (Pygoscelis antarcticus) show little sexual dimorphism and sexing by direct observation can be difficult. Through molecular techniques, male and female adults were identified at Stinker Point, Elephant Island, South Shetland Islands, in the 2011-12 and 2012-13 breeding seasons. In the assessment of sexual dimorphism using morphological characteristics, males were 6.0-9.4% larger than females. From the most significant morphological measurements, a discriminant function was formulated that classified 80.6% of the birds correctly. In addition, our data on bill length and depth were compared with those in the literature to evaluate sexual dimorphism between different breeding locations and to test the performance of the discriminant function. There were no differences in sexual dimorphism between breeding locations. However, the discriminant function should be used with caution because some penguins may be misclassified. Therefore, when there is doubt about the accuracy of morphometric approaches, application of molecular sexing techniques is recommended."
"Several recent papers have criticized the scientific robustness of the fisheries management system used by the Commission for the Conservation of Antarctic Marine Living Resources (CCAMLR), including that for Ross Sea toothfish. Here we present a response from the wider CCAMLR community to address concerns and to correct some apparent misconceptions about how CCAMLR acts to promote conservation whilst allowing safe exploitation in all of its fisheries. A key aspect of CCAMLR's approach is its adaptive feedback nature; regular monitoring and analysis allows for adjustments to be made, as necessary, to provide a robust management system despite the statistical uncertainties inherent in any single assessment. Within the Ross Sea, application of CCAMLR's precautionary approach has allowed the toothfish fishery to develop in a steady fashion with an associated accumulation of data and greater scientific understanding. Regular stock assessments of the fishery have been carried out since 2005, and the 2013 stock assessment estimated current spawning stock biomass to be at 75% of the pre-exploitation level. There will always be additional uncertainties which need to be addressed, but where information is lacking the CCAMLR approach to management ensures exploitation rates are at a level commensurate with a precautionary approach."
"Microbial mats are common in polar streams and often dominate benthic biomass. Climate change may be enhancing the variability of stream flows in the Antarctic, but so far studies investigating mat responses to disturbance have been limited in this region. Mat regrowth was evaluated following disturbance by experimentally scouring rocks from an ephemeral McMurdo Dry Valley stream over two summers (2001-02 and 2012-13). Mats were sampled at the beginning and resampled at the end of the flow season. In 2012-13, mats were additionally resampled mid-season along with previously undisturbed controls. In 2001-02 rocks regained 47% of chlorophyll a and 40% of ash-free dry mass by the end of the summer, while in 2012-13 rocks regrew 18% and 27%, respectively. Mat stoichiometry differed between summers, and reflected differences in biomass and discharge. Oscillatoria spp. were greatest on scoured rocks and Phormidium spp. on undisturbed rocks. Small diatoms Humidophila and Fistulifera spp. increased throughout the summer in all mats, with the latter more abundant in scoured communities. Collectively, these data suggest that mats are variable intra-annually, responsive to hydrology and require multiple summers to regrow initial biomass once lost. These results will aid the interpretation of long-term data, as well as inform Antarctic Specially Managed Area protocols."
"Organochlorine contaminants (OCs) and polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs) were investigated in the eggs of five bird species from the South Shetland Islands. Additionally, OCs and PBDEs were also analysed in embryos of two species. The concentration ranges in eggs were (ng g(-1) wet weight) 2.11 to 541 for polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), < 0.25 to 0.88 for PBDEs, 2.45 to 405 for p, p'-DDE and 1.50 to 603 for mirex. The PCBs were predominant in the eggs of Macronectes giganteus, Catharacta antarctica and Larus dominicanus, whereas hexachlorobenzene (HCB) was the major compound found in the eggs of Pygoscelis antarcticus and Sterna vittata. The PBDE congeners were detected only in the eggs of C. antarctica (PBDE 47 and 153) and S. vittata (PBDE 47). There were differences in OC concentrations of up to two orders of magnitude between M. giganteus embryos which were related to the development stage and OC concentrations in the respective eggs. Trophic ecology and post-breeding dispersal exerted an influence on contaminant patterns. Comparisons with data from the literature indicate an increase in the concentrations of some OCs over recent years."
"The Ross Sea polynya is one of the most productive regions in the Southern Ocean. However, limited access and high spatio-temporal variability of physical and biological processes limit the use of conventional oceanographic methods to measure early season primary productivity. High-resolution observations from two Seagliders provide insights into the timing of a bloom in the southern Ross Sea polynya in December 2010. Changes in chlorophyll and oxygen concentrations are used to assess bloom dynamics. Using a ratio of dissolved oxygen to carbon, net primary production is estimated over the duration of the bloom showing a sensitive balance between net autotrophy and heterotrophy. The two gliders, observing spatially distinct regions during the same period, found net community production rates of -0.9 +/- 0.7 and 0.7 +/- 0.4 g Cm-2 d(-1). The difference highlights the spatial variability of biological processes and is probably caused by observing different stages of the bloom. The challenge of obtaining accurate primary productivity estimates highlights the need for increased observational efforts, particularly focusing on subsurface processes not resolved using surface or remote observations. Without an increased observational effort and the involvement of emerging technologies, it will not be possible to determine the seasonal trophic balance of the Ross Sea polynya and quantify the shelf's importance in carbon export."
"It has been demonstrated that persistent organic pollutants (POPs) can affect the immune system of mammals and birds. In this study, the concentration of different POPs and leukocytes in blood samples from three chinstrap penguin (Pygoscelis antarctica) populations was analysed in order to assess the impact on haematological parameters. Using blood sample smears, basophils, eosinophils, heterophils, lymphocytes and monocytes were quantified. Mature and immature red blood cells were counted and cell alterations in both white and red blood cells were analysed. At the same time, whole blood was analysed for POPs. The results showed that contaminants, such as dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane and its metabolites (Sigma DDT), as well as polychlorinated biphenyls (Sigma PCB), had significant correlations to eosinophils, lymphocytes and heterophils. This indicates possible immunohaematological alterations derived from exposure to such contaminants. Cytological alterations were also observed, such as cytotoxic granules, toxic heterophils, and atypical and granulated lymphocytes, which would demonstrate that these seabirds are being exposed to stress agents that could be producing some alterations at a leukocytary cellular level."
"The theory of propagation in a direction almost parallel to the Earth's magnetic field is reviewed, calculating the group refractive index of the ordinary ray in the presence of electron-neutral collisions. An electron density profile is estimated from the ordinary trace and is used to compute the z-ray trace. It is shown that this reconstruction can help to identify the rare cases of z-rays from among the numerous cases of duplicate ordinary traces, due to reflection from two different directions."
"The development of coastal polynyas, areas of enhanced heat flux and sea ice production strongly depend on atmospheric conditions. In Antarctica, measurements are scarce and models are essential for the investigation of polynyas. A robust quantification of polynya exchange processes in simulations relies on a realistic representation of atmospheric conditions in the forcing dataset. The sensitivity of simulated coastal polynyas in the south-western Weddell Sea to the atmospheric forcing is investigated with the Finite-Element Sea ice-Ocean Model (FESOM) using daily NCEP/NCAR reanalysis data (NCEP), 6 hourly Global Model Europe (GME) data and two different hourly datasets from the high-resolution Consortium for Small-Scale Modelling (COSMO) model. Results are compared for April to August in 2007-09. The two coarse-scale datasets often produce the extremes of the data range, while the finer-scale forcings yield results closer to the median. The GME experiment features the strongest winds and, therefore, the greatest polynya activity, especially over the eastern continental shelf. This results in higher volume and export of High Salinity Shelf Water than in the NCEP and COSMO runs. The largest discrepancies between simulations occur for 2008, probably due to differing representations of the ENSO pattern at high southern latitudes. The results suggest that the large-scale wind field is of primary importance for polynya development."
"Ice shelves fringing Antarctica are sensitive indicators of climate change due to the direct interface with the atmosphere and ocean. Meltwater induced by atmospheric warming percolates from the surface into hydrofractures and affects shelf stability. Surface melting reduces the microwave backscattering; thus backscatter data is useful in melt monitoring. The Ku-band scatterometer derived melting index (MI) was utilized to assess the decadal (2000-10) variability observed over Antarctic ice shelves. The low intensity melting observed over large ice shelves and high intensity melting observed over the Larsen, Amery, West and Shackleton ice shelves are discussed. Acorrelation of around 93% was observed between MI variation and rift propagation over Amery Ice Shelf. The El Nino and the Southern Oscillation (ENSO) correlation with MI was also investigated. The paper highlights that scatterometer derived information has the potential to assess meltwater production and rift propagation."
"Based on data from low elevation lake sites, previous studies have suggested three quantitative relationships related to summer (December, January and February) air temperatures in the Dry Valleys of Antarctica: i) decrease with altitude at the dry lapse rate of 9.8 degrees C km(-1), ii) increase with distance from the coast at a rate of 0.09 degrees C km(-1), and iii) degree-days above freezing during the summer months is logarithmically proportional to the maximum summer air temperature. Here, we tested the first two of these rules at high elevation sites in Upper Wright Valley. Direct measurements confirmed that the summer lapse rate followed the dry lapse rate. For the three furthest stations, Tyrol Valley, Mount Fleming and Horseshoe Crater, the average difference between the measurements and the predicted summer monthly averages are -2.1 +/- 1.4 degrees C, -0.5 +/- 1.0 degrees C and -0.4 +/- 0.9 degrees C, respectively. By contrast, at Linnaeus Terrace (54 km from the coast) the monthly average is warmer than predicted by several degrees: +4.3 +/- 1.3 degrees C. The inland temperature gradient at these high elevation sites may result from sunlight effects rather than coastal wind as previously shown for the lower valleys. The warm conditions observed c. 50 km from the coast may reflect a zone affected by both sunlight and coastal wind."
"Evaporite salts are abundant around the McMurdo region, Antarctica (similar to 78 degrees S) due to very low precipitation, low relative humidity, and limited overland flow. Hygroscopic salts in the McMurdo Dry Valleys (MDVs) are preferentially formed in locations where liquid water is present in the austral summer, including along ephemeral streams, ice-covered lake boundaries, or shallow groundwater tracks. In this study, we collected salts from the Miers, Garwood, and Taylor Valleys on the Antarctic continent, as well as around McMurdo Station on Ross Island in close proximity to water sources with the goal of understanding salt geochemistry in relationship to the hydrology of the area. Halite is ubiquitous; sodium is the major cation (ranging from 70%-90% of cations by meq kg(-1) sediment) and chloride is the major anion (>50%) in nearly all samples. However, a wide variety of salt phases and morphologies are tentatively identified through scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and X-ray diffraction (XRD) work. We present new data that identifies trona (Na-3(CO3)(HCO3)center dot 2H(2)O), tentative gaylussite (Na2Ca(CO3)(2)center dot 5H(2)O), and tentative glauberite (Na2Ca(SO4)(2)) in the MDV, of which the later one has not been documented previously. Our work allows for the evaluation of processes that influence brine evolution on a local scale, consequently informing assumptions underlying large-scale processes (such as paleoclimate) in the MDV. Hydrological modeling conducted in FREZCHEM and PHREEQC suggests that a model based on aerosol deposition alone in low elevations on the valley floor inadequately characterizes salt distributions found on the surfaces of the soil because it does not account for other hydrologic inputs/outputs. Implications for the salt distributions include their use as tracers for paleolake levels, geochemical tracers of ephemeral water tracks or ""wet patches"" in the soil, indicators of chemical weathering products, and potential delineators of ecological communities."
"Overall mass loss from the Greenland ice sheet nearly doubled during the early 2000s resulting in an increased contribution to sea-level rise, with this step-change being mainly attributed to the widespread frontal retreat and accompanying dynamic thinning of tidewater glaciers. Changes in glacier calving-front positions are easily derived from remotely sensed imagery and provide a record of dynamic change. However, ice-sheet-wide studies of calving fronts have been either spatially or temporally limited. In this study multiple calving-front positions were derived for 199 Greenland marine-terminating outlet glaciers with width greater than 1 km using Landsat imagery for the 11-year period 2000-2010 in order to identify regional seasonal and inter-annual variations. During this period, outlet glaciers were characterized by sustained and substantial retreat summing to more than 267 km, with only 11 glaciers showing overall advance. In general, the pattern of mass loss detected by GRACE (Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment) and other measurements is reflected in the calving record of Greenland glaciers. Our results suggest several regions in the south and east of the ice sheet likely share controls on their dynamic changes, but no simple single control is apparent."
"Recent findings indicated spruce from North America and larch from eastern Siberia to be the dominating tree species of Arctic driftwood throughout the Holocene. However, changes in source region forest and river characteristics, as well as ocean current dynamics and sea ice extent likely influence its spatiotemporal composition. Here, we present 2556 driftwood samples from Greenland, Iceland, Svalbard, and the Faroe Islands. A total of 498 out of 969 Pinus sylvestris ring width series were cross-dated at the catchment level against a network of Eurasian boreal reference chronologies. The central Siberian Yenisei and Angara Rivers account for 91% of all dated pines, with their outermost rings dating between 1804 and 1999. Intensified logging and timber rafting along the Yenisei and Angara in the mid-20th century, together with high discharge rates, explain the vast quantity of material from this region and its temporal peak ca. 1960. Based on the combined application of wood-anatomical and dendrochronological techniques on a well-replicated data set, our results question the assumption that Arctic driftwood mainly consists of millennial-old larch and spruce. Nevertheless, data from other species and regions, together with longer boreal reference chronologies, are needed for generating reliable proxy archives at the interface of marine and terrestrial environments."
"The diatom succession and sedimentation during 2011 in a subtropical, deep alpine lake (Lugu Hu, Southwest China) were studied. The seasonal patterns in diatom assemblages were related to light, nutrient availability, and thermal regime. Peaks in the concentration of the planktonic diatoms (Asterionella formosa and Cyclotella ocellata) occurred in the metalimnion during autumn when light penetration was greater and silica concentrations were higher. The spring peak of Cyclostephanos dubius appeared to be a result of the combination of a well-mixed water column, higher nutrient concentration, and low light availability. Its sedimentation in late spring suggests that the sinking rates of C. dubius increased rapidly with the onset of stratification. However, the minimal catches of A. formosa and C. ocellata in sediment traps during autumn suggest they were still actively growing with very low sedimentation losses. The catch of benthic Fragilaria species in sediment traps during early spring and autumn reflected their resuspension from shallow water and transfer into pelagic zone as thermal stratification breaks down. The results provide important information for the interpretation of paleolimnological records from the lakes in Southwest China."
"Differentiations in reproductive traits along climatic gradients can be substantial for a species to spread along a wide spatial range. We compared the reproductive effort allocated to first egg sacs of five species of the genus Pardosa: P. palustris (Linnaeus 1758), P. amentata (Clerck 1757), P. lugubris (Walckenaer 1802), P. hyperborea (Thorell 1872), and P. riparia (C. L. Koch 1833) along three elevation transects in central Norway. We tested whether population differences are consistent among the three transects, respectively along the elevational gradient. We assumed that the harsh environments of alpine areas would lead to adaptations in reproductive traits resulting in larger eggs but smaller clutches at higher elevations. The results show that female size and egg number were positively correlated among all species. However, no clear elevation-related trend was found. Other traits did not change consistently between species and along the elevational gradient. We assume that local microclimatic impacts on spider fitness are a crucial but poorly understood factor. Without further knowledge about adaptation and phenotypic plasticity in ectotherms, modeling of possible future reproduction biology might remain flawed."
"Previous work has explored the contribution of bedrock weathering to soil formation in alpine environments of the northeastern United States. In contrast, the role of surficial sediments as a parent material has received little attention. This study investigated the development of alpine soils in relation to surficial sediments and bedrock in part of the Presidential Range of the White Mountains, New Hampshire, U.S.A. Published mapping of the study area indicates that five contrasting bedrock units are thinly mantled by glacial sediment, providing the opportunity to evaluate the relative importance of these two potential soil parent materials. Samples collected from 25 pedons were analyzed for a variety of physical, chemical, and mineralogical properties. Soil profiles have distinct Oa, A, Bw, and BC horizons. X-ray diffraction analysis reveals the presence of chlorite in soils above all bedrock formations, despite the absence of this mineral in several bedrock types. Trace element concentrations are relatively uniform for all soils with no clear relationship to underlying bedrock. Differences in median grain size are significant in soils over different bedrock formations; however, extractable cations, cation exchange capacity, exchangeable acidity, and other soil properties exhibit no significant differences. The overall similarity of soils above strongly contrasting bedrock formations indicates that these soils are forming in a homogenous mantle of glacial sediment deposited in the late Wisconsin, and that bedrock weathering does not contribute to pedogenesis to measurable degree in this setting. Preservation of glacial sediment in the study area may be a function of the amount originally deposited, reduced erosion rates on relatively gentle slopes, or another unidentified factor."
"Reindeer (Rangifer tarandus L.) are the most important large mammalian herbivores in Lapland, strongly affecting the dynamics of vegetation by grazing and trampling, and this is likely in turn to have consequences for the soil processes. We have investigated the changes occurring in above-and belowground biomasses, and soil C dynamics (CO2 efflux, soil C content, soil microbial biomass) among areas grazed and not grazed by reindeer. Our study areas are located in the northern boreal subarctic coniferous forest (undisturbed Scots pine [Pinus sylvestris L.] forests that are naturally lichen-dominated). Our study showed that grazing by reindeer decreased the biomass and cover of lichens in the area significantly. Also the tree regeneration was affected by grazing, as we had much less tree regeneration in the grazed areas. In subarctic mature pine forest, grazing did not affect the soil temperature or the soil moisture. We found no statistically significant effect of grazing on the soil CO2 efflux, soil C stock, and the soil microbial C biomass. Soil microbial N biomass was significantly lower in the grazed areas compared to the non-grazed areas. Our results indicate that in the northern boreal subarctic coniferous forests, grazing by reindeer can be considered as ""C neutral."""
"Little is known about the growth or production of alpine cushion plant communities in the southern hemisphere, even though they dominate many high elevation peat-accumulating ecosystems in this region. We measured the growth and organic carbon production in four Distichia muscoides cushion plant-dominated peatlands in the tropical Andes of Bolivia, South America. Height growth was measured using the modified crank wire system. Cores were collected at the end of the 18-month study period to determine the biomass and organic carbon production rate. Bulk density averaged 0.081 g cm(-3). Total height increase ranged from 0.96 to 5.37 cm yr(-1), indicating very rapid growth. Most growth occurred during the austral summer wet season. Mean organic carbon production for the four sites ranged from 1.5 to 4.0 kg C m(-2) yr(-1) and is among the most rapid rates of potential peat accumulation known for high elevation or high latitude ecosystems on Earth."
"Among the various plant traits, phenology is one of the most sensitive to environmental changes. Nitrogen (N) has been reported to be an important factor constraining plant growth, while N deposition is an increasing concern due to social and economic development. However, studies exploring influences of atmospheric N deposition on alpine plant phenology have been barely reported. We conducted a N addition gradient experiment in an alpine meadow on the plateau to examine plants' phenological response. The results suggest that N addition plays an important role in regulating plant phenology, but only for the dominant species; specifically, the budding time of Kobresia pygmaea advanced in response to N addition. The prolonged lengths of flower phase and reproductive period of K. pygmaea were mainly ascribed to an earlier start of the growing season and more resources being allocated to reproductive growth in the N-rich soil. The N addition caused no effect on the phenology of the accompanying species. There were no obvious phenology differences among each N addition treatment. The earlier budding time and the prolonged growing season of the dominant species in response to the N addition means a longer provision duration of food sources to local herders, which can facilitate local economic development."
"Optimal foraging theory predicts tradeoffs in animals balancing net energy intake and predator avoidance. In particular, overall foraging activity could be low if (1) perception of predation risk is high or (2) abiotic conditions are suboptimal. American pikas (Ochotona princeps) are small, food-hoarding mammals whose foraging opportunities are restricted by heat and risk of predation. If hiking disturbance is perceived by pikas as predation risk, it could reduce the amount of food stored overwinter, possibly affecting survival. We simulated hiker disturbance events for 48 pikas in Mount Revelstoke and Glacier National Parks, British Columbia, to estimate foraging time lost due to hikers. We tested risk avoidance hypotheses using four indicators of risk behavior: alert distance (D-A), flight initiation distance (D-F), exit delay (T-E), and delay in return to forage (T-R). All hiker disturbance events elicited antipredator behaviors in foraging pikas and reduced foraging time; however, when compared to increasing temperatures over 4-6 hour observation periods, the latter best predicted a reduction in pikas' foraging activity. For every 1 degrees C increase in temperature, pika foraging activity decreased by 3%. Pikas near trails (< 50 m) lost an average of 4.1 (SE = 0.6) minutes of foraging time per disturbance event compared to 13.2 (SE = 1.7) minutes lost by pikas with territories > 100 m away from trails. Such differences might reflect habituation in pikas undergoing frequent disturbance. Monitoring pika populations for declines would be sensible given projected trends in warming climate and potential increases in hiking traffic."
"The subarctic landscape is composed of a complex mosaic of vegetation, geology and topography, which control both the hydrology and biogeochemistry of streams across space and time. We present a synoptic sampling campaign that aimed to estimate dissolved C export variability under low-flow conditions from a subarctic landscape. The results included measurements of stream discharge and concentrations of both dissolved organic carbon (DOC), dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC), and carbon dioxide (CO2) for 32 subcatchments of the Abiskojokka catchment in northern Sweden. For these subarctic headwater streams, we found that DOC, DIC and CO2 concentrations showed significant variability (p < 0.05) relative to catchment size, discharge, specific discharge, lithology, electrical conductivity, weathering products, and the estimated travel time of water through the subcatchment. Our results indicate that neither vegetation cover nor lithology alone could explain the concentrations and mass flux rates of DOC and DIC. Instead, we found that mass flux rates of DOC, DIC, and CO2 depended mainly on specific discharge and water travel time. Furthermore, our results demonstrate the importance of studying lateral carbon transport in combination with hydrological flow paths at small scales to establish a knowledge foundation applicable for expected carbon cycle and hydroclimatic shifts due to climate change."
"The recovery of tundra vegetation and the depth of permafrost thaw were observed on the Seward Peninsula, Alaska, the site of a wildfire in 2002. The study compared the vegetation in burned and adjacent unburned tundra from 5 to 10 years post-fire. The effects of the fire on the vegetation varied between species and were spatially variable at the stand scale. The cover of evergreen shrubs, bryophytes, and lichens was still drastically decreased 5 years after the fire and had not recovered even 10 years after the fire. By contrast, the cover of graminoids, especially Eriophorum vaginatum, and of the deciduous shrub Vaccinium uliginosum increased. The depth of permafrost thaw increased, and its spatial pattern was related to vegetation structure; specifically, deeper thaw corresponded to graminoid-rich areas, and shallower thaw corresponded to shrub-rich areas. As the E. vaginatum cover increased, the thaw depth recovered to that of the unburned area, and the spatial variation had disappeared 10 years after the fire. Our results indicate that both the prefire vegetation structure and the differences in the regrowth properties between species play important roles in the early stage of tundra ecosystem recovery after wildfire. Our findings also show that the favorable growing conditions related to deeper thaw do not last long."
"Bryophytes from seven different genera colonized 3- to 6-year-old ground near a receding glacier in central South Norway. Microscopic studies of the gut content in pioneer invertebrates revealed that mosses were grazed upon by four species: an abundant and large Collembola (Bourletiella hortensis), a moss-eating Byrrhidae beetle (Simplocaria metallica), and two omnivorous Carabidae beetles (Amara alpina and A. quenseli). The three most abundant moss species were preferred by the moss-eaters: Pohlia filum, Ceratodon purpureus, and Bryum arcticum. Special parts of the moss plant could be selected. Three other Collembola species present were classified as herbivores because they had diatom algae in their gut, indicating that they grazed on terrestrial biofilm. Chironomidae midges hatching from young ponds represented an important element in the gut content of three common predators: the Opiliones Mitopus morio, and two Carabidae beetles Nebria nivalis and Bembidion hastii. The present data show that chlorophyll-based food chains start almost immediately on bare ground, but in a rather invisible way by tiny pioneer mosses and terrestrial biofilm with diatom algae. Pioneer mosses may be regarded as ""drivers"" in early animal succession, before higher plants establish. Since several of the pioneer invertebrates were herbivores or omnivores, the present community did not fit with the ""predator first"" hypothesis."
"We present a new open-source, collaborative ""COupled Snowpack and Ice surface energy and MAss balance model"" (COSIMA) that is evaluated for Zhadang glacier, Tibetan Plateau. The model is calibrated, run, and validated based on in situ measurements and atmospheric model data from the High Asia Refined analysis (HAR) over the period April 2009 to June 2012. Results for the model runs forced by both in situ measurements and HAR agree well with observations of various atmospheric, glaciological, surface, and subsurface parameters on the glacier. A time-lapse camera system next to the glacier provides a 3-year image time series of the mean transient snow line altitude and the snow cover pattern, which is used for the spatial and temporal validation of the model. The model output corresponds very well to the observed temporal and spatial snow cover variability. The model is then run for a 10-year period of October 2001 to September 2011 forced with HAR data. In general, the radiation components dominate the overall energy turnover (65%), followed by the turbulent fluxes (31%). The generally dry atmosphere on the Tibetan Plateau causes sublimation to be responsible for 26% of the total mass loss. A proportion of 11% of the surface and subsurface melt refreezes within the snowpack."
"AimLarge-scale DNA barcoding allows the simultaneous assessment of variation in community composition at species level and below. We here propose that the patterns emerging across multiple hierarchical levels can be used to discern the effects of neutral and non-neutral macroecological processes, which otherwise have proven difficult to separate. LocationIberian Peninsula. MethodsWe performed cox1 barcoding on 20 complete assemblages of leaf beetles for 4533 individuals of 203 species. The neutrality of cox1 sequence evolution was tested using Tajima's test. Haplotypes (n=2020) were grouped into nested n-step networks of up to five intraspecific hierarchical levels. We then assessed whether the spatial variation in assemblage composition at all hierarchical levels from haplotype to species was self-similar (fractal) and predictable from level to level. ResultsTajima's test on a subset of widely sampled species (n=136) was consistent with neutral evolution in 83% of the species, but only 3% of cases exhibited balancing selection. Multiple hierarchical levels representing haplotype genealogies of various ages showed a similar rate of distance decay of assemblage similarity. In addition, we found strong log-log correlations between hierarchical level (lineage age) and number of lineages, lineage range size and assemblage similarity. Similarity at the species level was strongly correlated to similarity at the haplotype level for the whole assemblage (r(2)=0.75) or for within-species haplotype similarity (mean r(2)=0.17, SE=0.03). Main conclusionsThese findings suggest great regularities in the pattern of assemblage variation at all lineage ages that are best explained by the enduring action of stochastic (neutral) processes of mutation and dispersal. The multi-hierarchical analysis therefore bridges predictions of the neutral theory of molecular evolution and the neutral theory of biodiversity. Neutral processes thus emerge as a unifying principle of ecology and evolution, which has deep implications in biodiversity assessment and conservation."
"AimThe recently proposed maximum entropy theory of ecology predicts that all nested species-area relationships (SARs) will collapse to a single, universal curve that exhibits a decreasing log-log slope with increasing scale, suggesting that the power law form of the SAR is invalid at any scale. In this analysis we test the generality of this scale collapse behaviour and determine the scale at which approximate power law behaviour of the SAR is predicted to occur. LocationGlobal. MethodsWe use common SAR models to recursively upscale SARs to (1) look for scale collapse of SARs built from different community assumptions and (2) identify the scale at which approximate power law SARs are recovered. We explore four SAR models in which species abundance distributions and the spatial aggregation of species vary within and across scales according to observed patterns. ResultsWe show that scale collapse is a property of nested SARs, not of maximum entropy theory, and that many types of SARs can exhibit scale-collapsed curves that follow the general pattern of empirical communities. Moreover, we use the scale-collapsed curves to show that power law behaviour is not predicted to occur at the scale of most SAR studies and that variation in species spatial aggregation or the scaling of species abundance distributions are needed to produce power law SARs at realistic scales. Main conclusionsOur findings show that power law behaviour of nested SARs is rare and that communities displaying approximate power law SARs may exhibit predictable characteristics within and across scale, such as interspecific variation in aggregation. Our findings regarding the general rarity of power law behaviour suggests that careful consideration of the curvature of a SAR and the scale of an ecological community are necessary before using power law SARs to predict biodiversity across scales."
"AimGeographical disparities in the effect of the environment on population dynamics have been shown to follow a core-periphery gradient when peripheral populations are less abundant and occur in marginal habitat. Whether the gradient in environmental influence occurs in the absence of a gradient in abundance is not known. We tested whether duck populations on the periphery of their main breeding region were more strongly affected by environmental stochasticity and less abundant than at the core. LocationThe Prairie Pothole Region of central United States and Canada MethodsWe used the North American Waterfowl Breeding Population and Habitat Survey to model the dynamics of 10 duck species at 1059 sites spanning 1961-2012. We used the North American Breeding Bird Survey to measure abundance at the same sites, averaged over the same time span. We used structural equation models to characterize relationships among a site's distance from the regional centre, a site's abundance, and the degree to which a site's ducks were affected by environmental stochasticity. ResultsEnvironmental stochasticity never strongly contributed to population dynamics in the region's core. However, we did not find a linear increase in environmental stochasticity with increasing distance from the core. For seven species, we found that environmental stochasticty was stronger in sites of lower abundance. For only two species did average abundance decline from the region's core to periphery. Main conclusionsVariability in the magnitude of environmental stochasticity follows coarse spatial differences in wetland productivity. Yet, among peripheral sites, the contribution of the environment to population dynamics varies, possibly reflecting the importance of the local environment and dispersal."
"AimFossil records are being increasingly used to help understand the consequences of climate change for biodiversity. Pollen records from the late Quaternary are among the most commonly used fossil data, but pollen-based inferences of biodiversity can potentially be confounded by spatial and taxonomic uncertainties and the influence of non-climatic abiotic factors such as soils on vegetation-climate relationships. Using paired pollen and vegetation inventories, we assess the fidelity of pollen-based estimates of compositional turnover of vegetation along environmental gradients given various sources of uncertainty. LocationEastern United States. MethodsWe used modern pollen records and forest composition data from Forest Inventory and Analysis (FIA) plots to fit generalized dissimilarity models. To address how uncertainties in pollen records affect estimates of turnover, we coarsened the vegetation data spatially from individual plots to 10- and 30-arcmin resolution and taxonomically from species to genus. To determine whether soil properties influenced turnover, we used deviance partitioning between models including climate or soil variables versus models with a combination of both. ResultsPollen-based estimates of turnover were highly correlated with those based on FIA data, but tended to be lower, mainly due to differences in taxonomic resolution and secondarily to differences in spatial resolution. Neither spatial nor taxonomic uncertainty substantially reduced the correlation between pollen- and FIA-based estimates of turnover. FIA data best matched pollen records when they were aggregated to genus and 30-arcmin resolution. Vegetation-climate relationships were similar across datasets, although models sometimes differed. The influence of soil variables was negligible compared with climate variables and did not improve model fit. Pollen thresholds did not greatly affect the form and strength of pollen-vegetation relationships. Main conclusionsPollen can act as a robust proxy for vegetation turnover, thereby supporting the use of pollen-based estimates of turnover to predict temporal changes in vegetation."
"AimDetermine if differences in the climatic niche between conspecific adult and juvenile trees of the western Unites States vary by species traits and to assess if forest canopies moderate the sensitivity of juvenile trees to climatic variation. LocationThe western Unites States. MethodsUsing data from the USDA Forest Inventory and Analysis programme, we compare the distribution of conspecific adult and juvenile trees for 62 western US tree species. We relate demographic niche differences to species traits including shade and drought tolerance. We model recruitment under projected climate change using generalized linear mixed models, probabilistic uncertainty accounting, forest structural data and projected changes in the climatic water balance. ResultsOn average juveniles of western US tree species occupy a climatic subset of their conspecific adults. Demographic niche differences increase as species shade and drought tolerance increase and are greatest at climatic range margins, indicating the potential for range contractions. Models calibrated solely with climate data project recruitment declines for 2080 that are 47% larger on average than models that also account for forest structure. Main conclusionsClimate change-driven declines in recruitment in western US tree species may be partly offset by the moderating effect of forest canopies. The importance of this stabilizing process will depend on whether a given site is disturbed and the traits of resident species, including their ability to utilize sites that have buffered microclimates. Conversely, our results suggest that broad-scale disturbances which result in the loss of forest canopy will amplify the effects of climate change on tree recruitment."
"AimThe phylogenetic constraint hypothesis of flowering phenology states that closely related species flower at similar times of the year. We test this hypothesis for the Chinese angiosperm flora and assess additional effects of growth form, deciduousness, pollination mode and fruit type. We further examine whether the phylogenetic conservatism of flowering phenology tends to increase from tropical to temperate latitudes. LocationChina. MethodsThe midpoint of flowering time for 19,631 angiosperm species present in China was compiled. The phylogenetic signal for flowering time was evaluated for the whole country using the Blomberg K-value (adjusted for circular data). We then regressed the phylogenetic signal for 28 provinces as a function of their latitude. An analysis of variance for circular data was conducted to test the differences among growth forms. Watson-Williams tests for circular flowering data were used to compare flowering dates between deciduous and evergreen species, animal-pollinated and wind-pollinated species, and fleshy and non-fleshy fruits. ResultsThe results support the phylogenetic constraint hypothesis. The phylogenetic signal at the whole country scale was lower than that at the province scale. Phylogenetic signal was also lower at tropical latitudes than at temperate latitudes. Flowering dates were associated with biological traits, with growth form having the largest effect. Main conclusionsFlowering phenology was constrained by phylogeny, and so one should account for phylogeny when studying the underlying drivers of phenology. The strength of phylogenetic conservatism appears weaker at larger scales and becomes stronger towards temperate regions. Flowering phenology also varies predictably according to biological traits such as growth form, suggesting that both phylogeny and traits could be used to inform the flowering times of species for which no phenology data are available. It remains to be tested whether the phylogenetic signal for other functional traits putatively related with flowering time also increases with latitude."
"AimTo develop an integrative framework to evaluate variation in aboveground carbon storage (AGC). A model that can be applied to understand and predict how global-change drivers influence tropical carbon sinks. LocationOld-growth tropical forests world-wide. MethodsUsing structural equation modelling (SEM), we propose an a priori model to evaluate the direct and indirect effects of climate, stand variables (basal area, tree diameter and wood density at plot level) and liana abundance on AGC. Our model indicated that stand variables increased AGC while liana abundance decreased AGC indirectly via negative effects on stand variables. We used a multigroup SEM to test the generality of our framework using a standardized dataset of 145 plots (0.1ha) in dry, moist and wet tropical forests. ResultsOur model explained over 85% variation in AGC and showed a positive and consistent relationship between stand variables and AGC across forests types. The effects of climate on AGC were indirect rather than direct, with negative effects of temperature in all forests. Liana abundance reduced tree diameter and basal area in moist forests, but did not affect AGC in wet or dry forests. Main conclusionsOur results suggest that climate affects AGC indirectly, via its direct influence on stand variables and liana abundance. The effects of lianas on AGC result from reductions in stand variables and are as important as climate for moist forests, which harbour the greatest tropical carbon pools. Our model was consistent across forest types. This highlights the usefulness of an integrative framework to improve predictions of the effects of drivers of global change on tropical carbon sinks."
"AimTo investigate the role of clay in limiting the development of woody biomass in drylands. LocationAustralia. MethodsSpatial data representing woody biomass, soil clay content and climate for the Australian continent were interpreted to explore the relationship between a moisture index and woody biomass on clay and non-clay substrates. Moisture and soil water potential were investigated through time for clay and sand plains. Sub-soil clay and other soil characteristics were compared between areas with and without high tree mortality after drought. ResultsThe substantially lower woody biomass on clay soils than non-clay soils in the drylands of the Australian continent verifies the inverse texture effect. A clay floodplain consistently held more water than an adjacent sandplain, but soil moisture in the clay was effectively inaccessible to plants for much longer periods because of more negative values of water potential in the clay soil. Small increases in sub-soil clay were associated with high tree mortality. Main conclusionsOur findings suggest that the inverse texture effect', which describes the negative association of woody biomass with soil clay content in drylands, may mostly relate to the moisture-retentive properties of clay rather than being caused by reduced infiltration and enhanced evaporation from clay-rich soils. Our evidence suggests that clay soils constrain woodiness in drylands by exacerbating water stress, and confirm the fundamental role of aridity in determining woody biomass and the global distribution of grassland."
"AimThe fluctuations of atmospheric methane (CH4) that have occurred in recent decades are not fully understood, particularly with regard to the contribution from wetlands. The application of spatially explicit parameters has been suggested as an effective method for reducing uncertainties in bottom-up approaches to wetland CH4 emissions, but has not been included in recent studies. Our goal was to estimate spatio-temporal patterns of global wetland CH4 emissions using a process model and then to identify the contribution of wetland emissions to atmospheric CH4 fluctuations. LocationGlobal. MethodsA process-based model integrated with full descriptions of methanogenesis (TRIPLEX-GHG) was used to simulate global wetland CH4 emissions. ResultsGlobal annual wetland CH4 emissions ranged from 209 to 245Tg CH4 year(-1) between 1901 and 2012, with peaks occurring in 1991 and 2012. There is a decreasing trend between 1990 and 2010 with a rate of approximately 0.48Tg CH4 year(-1), which was largely caused by emissions from tropical wetlands showing a decreasing trend of 0.44Tg CH4 year(-1) since the 1970s. Emissions from tropical, temperate and high-latitude wetlands comprised 59, 26 and 15% of global emissions, respectively. Main conclusionGlobal wetland CH4 emissions, the interannual variability of which was primary controlled by tropical wetlands, partially drive the atmospheric CH4 burden. The stable to decreasing trend in wetland CH4 emissions, a result of a balance of emissions from tropical and extratropical wetlands, was a particular factor in slowing the atmospheric CH4 growth rate during the 1990s. The rapid decrease in tropical wetland CH4 emissions that began in 2000 was supposed to offset the increase in anthropogenic emissions and resulted in a relatively stable level of atmospheric CH4 from 2000 to 2006. Increasing wetland CH4 emissions, particularly after 2010, should be an important contributor to the growth in atmospheric CH4 seen since 2007."
"AimMassive digitalization of natural history collections is now leading to a steep accumulation of publicly available species distribution data. However, taxonomic errors and geographical uncertainty of species occurrence records are now acknowledged by the scientific community - putting into question to what extent such data can be used to unveil correct patterns of biodiversity and distribution. We explore this question through quantitative and qualitative analyses of uncleaned versus manually verified datasets of species distribution records across different spatial scales. LocationThe American tropics. MethodsAs test case we used the plant tribe Cinchoneae (Rubiaceae). We compiled four datasets of species occurrences: one created manually and verified through classical taxonomic work, and the rest derived from GBIF under different cleaning and filling schemes. We used new bioinformatic tools to code species into grids, ecoregions, and biomes following WWF's classification. We analysed species richness and altitudinal ranges of the species. ResultsAltitudinal ranges for species and genera were correctly inferred even without manual data cleaning and filling. However, erroneous records affected spatial patterns of species richness. They led to an overestimation of species richness in certain areas outside the centres of diversity in the clade. The location of many of these areas comprised the geographical midpoint of countries and political subdivisions, assigned long after the specimens had been collected. Main conclusionOpen databases and integrative bioinformatic tools allow a rapid approximation of large-scale patterns of biodiversity across space and altitudinal ranges. We found that geographic inaccuracy affects diversity patterns more than taxonomic uncertainties, often leading to false positives, i.e. overestimating species richness in relatively species poor regions. Public databases for species distribution are valuable and should be more explored, but under scrutiny and validation by taxonomic experts. We suggest that database managers implement easy ways of community feedback on data quality."
"In their recent paper, Hanan etal. (Global Ecology and Biogeography, 2014, 23, 259-263) argue that the use of classification and regression trees (CARTs) to calibrate global remote sensing datasets, including the MODIS VCF tree-cover dataset, makes these data inappropriate for analysing the frequency distribution of tree cover. While we agree with their most general point - that the use of remote sensing products should be informed and deliberate - their analysis overlooks a few key aspects of the use of CARTs in generating global tree-cover data. Firstly, while their presentation of flaws in the use of CARTs is compelling, their use of hypothetical data obscures the reasons why CARTs are a useful tool. Secondly, they do not actually examine the error distributions of the MODIS VCF tree-cover data. Such an analysis, which we perform, revealed the following: (1) the MODIS VCF product may not be useful for differentiating over small ranges of tree cover (less thanc. 10%); (2) that the bimodality of low and high tree cover, with a frequency minimum at intermediate tree cover, is not attributable to bias in MODIS VCF tree-cover calibrations; and (3) that the MODIS VCF is not well-resolved below c. 20-30% tree cover, such that MODIS cannot be used with any confidence to evaluate multimodality in tree cover in that range. Further validation and calibration are likely to be helpful and, at low tree cover, necessary for improving MODIS VCF tree-cover estimates. However, the MODIS VCF - which has facilitated major steps in our ability to examine ecological phenomena at global scales - remains a useful tool for well-informed ecological analysis."
"Staver & Hansen (2015, Global Ecology and Biogeography, doi: 10.1111/geb.12285) comment on our recent paper (Hanan etal., Global Ecology and Biogeography, 2014, 23, 259-263) in which we argue that classification and regression tree methods used with remote sensing data to predict tree cover may bias inference of bifurcations in savanna vegetation communities. While we agree with several of their comments, we remain unconvinced that a remote sensing product based on an inherently discontinuous statistical approach can, or should, be used to test for discontinuities."

"AimOur goal was to test the hypothesis that ancient humans substantially contributed to shaping the current distribution of Brazil nut (Bertholletia excelsa), an Amazonian tree species that has been important for human livelihoods since pre-Columbian times. We scrutinized the putative association between Brazil nut and Amazonian Dark Earth soils (ADE) and geometric earthworks called geoglyphs, and examined the existence of continental patterns in human footprints on Brazil nut stands. LocationAmazon Basin. MethodsWe carried out a spatially explicit meta-analysis of the variation of Brazil nut stand metrics across the Amazon Basin based on 87,617 density estimates and 488 average stand diameter assessments, and related these to previously published datasets and suitability maps of Brazil nut, ADE and geoglyphs. ResultsWe found consistently higher Brazil nut suitability scores, stand densities and average stand diameters in the vicinities of ADE than at larger distances, regardless of their position along a gradient from south-western to north-eastern Amazonia. For geoglyph sites such a pattern was only found for Brazil nut habitat suitability scores. The available data further revealed an accumulation of Brazil nut stands with increasing densities and average diameters from south-western to central and eastern Amazonia. Main conclusionsOur findings suggest that the chance of encountering Brazil nut stands bearing the marks of past human influences increases from south-western to central and eastern Amazonia. In south-western Amazonia, the regeneration of Brazil nut seems to have been controlled predominantly by natural processes, whereas in central and eastern Amazonia, anthropogenic disturbance has been more important since pre-Columbian times. However, it remains challenging to disentangle human influences on the distribution and abundance of Brazil nut from existing environmental gradients across the Amazon Basin. In general, the results of this meta-analysis bode well for the future coexistence of Brazil nut with different forms of contemporary human land use."
"AimsClimate change can substantially alter ecological communities. However, we hypothesized that, even if novel communities emerge, those communities may not be novel in terms of functional composition. To infer the processes associated with rising temperatures, we evaluated elevational taxonomic/functional turnover of plant and invertebrate communities. Because climate change interacts synergistically with other environmental factors, and therefore is not the sole driver of change in ecological communities, we also considered how the taxonomic/functional composition of the communities would be affected by mammalian overgrazing/browsing, which has become prominent in the study region. LocationShiretoko National Park, Shiretoko Peninsular, Hokkaido, Japan. MethodsWe investigated the diversity of eight groups of organisms (taxa) in forests of northern Japan, and calculated the distance decay of taxonomic/functional similarity (SOrensen's -diversity) along an elevational gradient. A null model was used to separate functional turnover from taxonomic turnover. We then simulated how taxonomic/functional turnover along the gradient would be changed after non-random loss of species sensitive to mammalian herbivory. ResultsWe found that each group showed elevational decay in taxonomic similarity. Along an elevational gradient, species groups structured by stronger dispersal limitation showed faster species turnover. This suggested differences in the process of climate-induced species reassembly among the groups. We also found that elevational turnover of communities based on functional traits tended to be lower than that based on taxonomic identity for the majority of the groups, supporting our hypothesis of functional redundancy across the elevational gradient. We thus speculated that climate-induced emergence of taxonomically novel communities may have limited influence on critical ecosystem processes supported by functional diversity. Furthermore, while random species loss did not change functional turnover, non-random loss of species attributable to mammalian herbivory substantially accelerated elevational functional turnover of the taxa. This suggested a possible loss of the functional redundancy of communities. Main conclusionsFuture communities may be novel not simply because climates are changing at unprecedented rates but also because of the synergetic influences of other environmental changes. Thus ecological processes may be more seriously affected in the future than is generally anticipated based on existing climate-change scenarios, with possible consequences for ecosystem functioning."
"AimA major challenge for the emerging discipline of conservation biogeography is to identify conservation areas and understand the factors and processes that govern the spatial distribution of those areas. We aimed to identify high-priority conservation cells (HPCC) - 1 degrees cells that efficiently represent species - for amphibians, birds and mammals at the global extent, to identify the environmental variables associated with conservation priority, and to evaluate how well the areas of highest species richness correspond to these high-priority areas. LocationA global analysis. MethodsDistribution maps for 21,697 vertebrates and complementarity-based approaches were used to map HPCCs for vertebrates. We used 41 potential predictor variables and varimax-rotated factor analysis (VrFA) to identify sets of relatively uncorrelated environmental factors, and then used random forest models to investigate the relationships between VrFA factors and vertebrate conservation priorities. Finally, we evaluated whether species richness and threatened-species richness were efficient surrogates to identify HPCCs for each vertebrate taxon. ResultsFor each of the three taxa, HPCCs were concentrated in the Neotropical, Afrotropical and Indo-Malay biogeographical realms. The spatial distribution of HPCCs was strongly correlated with environmental variables, especially energy-related variables. The cells with the highest species richness did not correspond to HPCCs for either birds or mammals. DiscussionWe suggest that elucidating the patterns and drivers of conservation priority could become a major focus of conservation biogeography. The ability to identify high-priority conservation sites from the environmental conditions in those sites may improve how sites are prioritized for conservation, so that all or most species can be conserved in affordable areas."
"AimRecent progress in island biogeography indicates that classical island biogeography alone cannot encapsulate the complex and dynamic nature of island biogeographical processes. Factors such as habitat complexity and connectivity, and in the face of the Anthropocene, human disturbance and invasive species, may influence insular communities. The relative importance of these factors, however, may differ among groups of biota. Here we employed an information theoretic approach to investigate factors likely to explain patterns in species richness and assemblage composition of five different groups of arthropods (ants, beetles, flies, spiders and cockroaches) and native and exotic plants within an insular community. LocationCapricornia Cays located at the southern end of Great Barrier Reef, eastern Australia. MethodsArthropods were sampled from 14 cays using pitfall and Malaise traps and hand collecting. Plants were comprehensively surveyed on each island. We used univariate and multivariate generalized linear models with a model averaging technique, to calculate summed Akaike weights which quantified the relative importance of predictor variables in explaining variation in species richness and assemblage composition. ResultsWe found that infestation of the invasive ant Pheidole megacephala was negatively correlated with the species richness of ants, beetles and flies. Unlike species richness, only the assemblage composition of ants was related to P. megacephala infestation. Assemblage composition of other arthropod groups and plants was related to various factors, including island size (native plants), native plant species richness (beetles, flies and spiders) and presence of human disturbances (exotic plants and cockroaches). Main conclusionsThe information theoretic approach proved useful in determining the relative likelihood of factors influencing both univariate and multivariate data of insular fauna and flora. The results demonstrated that human disturbance and proliferation of invasive species can override other biogeographical processes. The relative importance of these factors, however, varied depending on the taxonomic groups studied."
"AimTo examine the roles of geohistorical and ecological factors in the development of butterfly assemblages on continental islands with multiple source pools. LocationThe Ryukyu Islands, Japan. This arc of continental islands is located between two source islands, Kyushu and Taiwan, and contains two major straits, the Tokara and Kerama gaps. MethodsA total of 489 butterfly species were identified on 59 islands, including the two source islands. The influences on species richness and rarity of latitude, area, elevation, and distances from the nearest source and from the nearest larger island were analysed using generalized linear models. The relationships between differences in area, elevation, and distance and dissimilarity between island butterfly faunas were evaluated by multiple regressions on distance matrices. The relationships between area, elevation, and distance from the source and dissimilarity to the source fauna were examined using linear models. The dissimilarity was based on the SOrensen index and its nestedness and turnover components. ResultsLatitude, area and isolation determined species richness and rarity, whereas differences in elevation and distance regulated species turnover between islands. The gaps between islands were associated with nestedness between island faunas. Area consistently had a negative relationship with the total dissimilarity to source fauna. The overall dissimilarity to Kyushu decreased with the distance from Kyushu, whereas dissimilarity to Taiwan increased with distance from Taiwan. Main conclusionsBoth environmental filtering and dispersal limitation determine the geographical patterns of butterfly assemblages in the Ryukyus. The present study focuses on the unique pattern wherein migration from Kyushu is facilitated on islands farther from Kyushu, while migration from Taiwan is inhibited on islands farther from Taiwan. The two source islands have contrasting roles that affect butterfly distributions unidirectionally. This study highlights the importance of resolving dissimilarity into nestedness and turnover components to elucidate the formation of island biota."
"AimWe used combined palaeobotanical and genetic data to assess whether Norway spruce (Picea abies) and Siberian spruce (Picea obovata), two major components of the Eurasian boreal forests, occupied separate glacial refugia, and to test previous hypotheses on their distinction, geographical delimitation and introgression. LocationThe range of Norway spruce in northern Europe and Siberian spruce in northern Asia. MethodsPollen data and recently compiled macrofossil records were summarized for the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM), late glacial and Holocene. Genetic variation was assessed in 50 populations using one maternally (mitochondrial nad1) and one paternally (chloroplast trnT-trnL) inherited marker and analysed using spatial analyses of molecular variance (SAMOVA). ResultsMacrofossils showed that spruce was present in both northern Europe and Siberia at the LGM. Congruent macrofossil and pollen data from the late glacial suggested widespread expansions of spruce in the East European Plain, West Siberian Plain, southern Siberian mountains and the Baikal region. Colonization was largely completed during the early Holocene, except in the formerly glaciated area of northern Europe. Both DNA markers distinguished two highly differentiated groups that correspond to Norway spruce and Siberian spruce and coincide spatially with separate LGM spruce occurrences. The division of the mtDNA variation was geographically well defined and occurred to the east of the Ural Mountains along the Ob River, whereas the cpDNA variation showed widespread admixture. Genetic diversity of both DNA markers was higher in western than in eastern populations. Main conclusionsNorth Eurasian Norway spruce and Siberian spruce are genetically distinct and occupied separate LGM refugia, Norway spruce on the East European Plain and Siberian spruce in southern Siberia, where they were already widespread during the late glacial. They came into contact in the basin of the Ob River and probably hybridized. The lower genetic diversity in the eastern populations may indicate that Siberian spruce suffered more from past climatic fluctuations than Norway spruce."
"AimPhylogeographical signatures of past population fragmentation and demographic change have been reported in several African rain forest trees. These signatures have usually been interpreted in the light of the Pleistocene forest refuge hypothesis, although dating these events has remained impracticable because of inadequate genetic markers. We assess the timing of interspecific and intraspecific genetic differentiation and demographic changes within two rain forest Erythrophleum tree species (Fabaceae: Caesalpinioideae). LocationTropical forests of Upper Guinea (West Africa) and Lower Guinea (Atlantic Central Africa). MethodsSix single-copy nuclear genes were used to characterize the phylogeographical patterns of the parapatric sister species Erythrophleumsuaveolens (characteristic of semi-deciduous or gallery forests) and Erythrophleumivorense (characteristic of evergreen forests). The number of gene pools within each species was determined and the timings of their divergence and past demographic changes were estimated using Bayesian-based coalescent approaches. ResultsThree geographically separated gene pools were identified within E.suaveolens, and a single gene pool was inferred in E.ivorense. All gene pools show signatures of demographic bottlenecks concomitant with the last glacial period (c. 120-12ka). Species-tree inferences show that the two species diverged c. 600ka, whereas the divergence between E.suaveolens gene pools was dated to the late Pleistocene (first divergence c. 120ka, second c. 60ka). Main conclusions(1) Molecular dating of demographic changes of two African tropical forest tree species is consistent with the Pleistocene forest refuge hypothesis. (2) Tree species from Guinean evergreen tropical forests might have been less affected by past climate change than semi-deciduous species. (3) Our phylogeographical data support a recent date (Holocene) of the last opening of the Dahomey Gap."
"AimThe evolutionary history of narrow endemic species has received little attention compared with that of more widely distributed species. Small effective population sizes and long-term isolation of many narrow endemic species make research on their genetic make-up important for their future conservation. In this study we investigated the genetic variation and historical distribution of an isolated plant, the monospecific genus Pseudomisopates, as an example of the phylogeographical history of narrow endemics. LocationCentral Range, Iberian Peninsula, Mediterranean Europe. MethodsWe used amplified fragment length polymorphisms (AFLPs), nuclear and plastid DNA sequences and species distribution modelling. Sequence data were analysed using statistical parsimony, molecular dating, and a coalescent-based Bayesian model of isolation with migration. Genetic diversity and differentiation analyses based on AFLP data were performed. We compared the detection of clones using AFLPs with the results of a previous study that used simple sequence repeats (SSRs). ResultsAFLP analysis revealed that SSRs underestimate clone number. The coalescent-based Bayesian model of isolation with migration suggested a late Pleistocene divergence between the populations of Pseudomisopates on two mountain massifs (Gredos and La Serrota), despite the presence of a large area suitable for population admixture. Moderate to high levels of genetic diversity and high effective population sizes were inferred. Main conclusionsOur results imply that the levels of genetic diversity within narrow endemic species from Mediterranean mountains could primarily be driven by extrinsic historical factors, rather than by intrinsic species-specific factors depending on their own biological characteristics. Narrow endemics are widely believed to harbour low genetic diversity because of small effective population sizes. However, this study and others on narrow endemic angiosperms demonstrate that narrow endemism does not necessarily result in low genetic diversity."
"AimTo investigate the phylogeography of the aposematic wood tiger moth (Parasemia plantaginis) across its Holarctic distribution and to explore how its genetic structure relates to geographical differences in hindwing warning coloration of males and females. Males have polymorphic hindwing coloration, while female hindwing coloration varies continuously, but no geographical analyses of coloration or genetic structure exist. LocationThe Holarctic. MethodsWe sequenced a fragment of the mitochondrial cytochrome c oxidase subunit I gene (COI) from 587 specimens. We also examined more current population structure by genotyping 569 specimens at 10 nuclear microsatellite loci. Species distribution modelling for present conditions and the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM) was performed to help understand genetic structure. Geographical patterns in hindwing warning coloration were described from 1428 specimens and compared to the genetic analyses. ResultsWe found only two instances of genetic divergence that coincided with distinct, yet imperfect, shifts in male hindwing coloration in the Caucasus region and Japan. A shift in female hindwing colour did not appear to be associated with genetic structure. A change from sexual monomorphism to sexual dimorphism was also observed. Mitogenetic (mtDNA) structure does not show the influence of glacial refugia during the LGM. Climate shifts following the LGM appear to have isolated the red Caucasus populations and other southerly populations. Populations at opposite ends of the moth's distribution showed high levels of differentiation in the microsatellite data analysis compared to the shallow mitogenetic structure, supporting a more recent divergence. Main conclusionsParasemia plantaginis populations appeared to have been historically well connected, but current populations are much more differentiated. This raises the possibility that incipient speciation may be occurring in portions of the species' distribution. Some changes in colour align to genetic differences, but others do not, which suggests a role for selective and non-selection based influences on warning signal variation."
"AimScenarios of aphid evolution suggest that adaptation to host plants plays a major role in aphid diversification. It is therefore commonly assumed that host association has also shaped the biogeographical patterns of aphids; particularly, it has been hypothesized that the intercontinental disjunctions observed in the Holarctic for many aphid groups resulted from the disappearance or migration of their hosts. We explored this hypothesis for the conifer-feeding genus Cinara, one of the most diverse and widely distributed aphid genera in the Holarctic. LocationHolarctic. MethodsSix DNA fragments from 361 specimens representing 92 species were used to reconstruct the phylogeny of Cinara species. We used species-delimitation methods to identify putative species, and estimated times of divergence using Bayesian relaxed clocks and fossil calibrations. We investigated rates of diversification, biogeographical and host-association history using maximum likelihood and Bayesian approaches. ResultsCinara originated in Asia c. 50Ma following a host switch to conifers from an angiosperm-feeding ancestor. The steady diversification observed since then suggests that this host switch did not cause adaptive radiation in Cinara, as previously assumed. Switches between conifer host genera could have facilitated the expansion of Cinara in the Holarctic, but the intercontinental disjunctions observed today are most likely the result of vicariance mediated by climatic or geological barriers. Main conclusionsThis study shows that biogeographical and diversification patterns in Cinara have not only been shaped by host-plant adaptation processes, but also by the climatic and geological changes that occurred through the Cenozoic."
"AimThe dated phylogeny of Breynia (including Sauropus) was used to analyse historical biogeographical patterns and to compare the speciation events with tectonic occurrences and biotic and abiotic aspects. LocationSoutheast Asia, Malesia and Australia. MethodsExisting molecular markers (trnS-trnG, accD-psaI, PHYC and ITS) were used in beast to make a Bayesian age estimate with an exponential relaxed molecular clock. The resulting cladograms and maximum clade credibility (MCC) tree were used as input in statistical dispersal-vicariance analysis (S-DIVA option in the rasp package). ResultsBreynia originated 25-20Ma in Thailand (western part of northern to southern Thailand) up to peninsular Malaysia. Dispersal occurred in various directions (India+Sri Lanka, China+Indochina, Malesia+Australia) establishing widespread species. Most species evolved locally in the area of origin and a relatively high number of species form limestone endemics. Main conclusionsThere is little correlation between tectonic movements and dispersal patterns in Breynia. Only the dispersal over Wallace's Line occurred when stepping stones were in place. Speciation, especially in the area of origin seems to be linked to soil (limestone endemics) and pollination, as indicated by the presence of deviating inflorescences in B. subgen. Sauropus (no pollinators are known yet) and the obligate moth pollination in B. sect. Breynia. Moreover, B. sect. Breynia and three widespread species of B. subgen. Sauropus have (more) fleshy fruits and all these taxa generally have wide distributions, probably because of bird dispersal."
"AimThe subduction of the Nazca Plate and the eastward propagation of the Andean orogenic wedge in western Amazonia caused the formation of arches or ridges that have influenced the modern configuration of the upper Amazon drainage and the diversification of biota. We used a lineage of 15 palm species (Astrocaryum sect. Huicungo, Arecaceae) to test two biogeographical hypotheses for lowland plants: (1) that vicariance resulted from tectonically mediated geographical barriers (population contraction), and (2) that recurrent dispersal events (population expansion) produced geographical isolation and subsequent speciation. LocationRain forests of South America. MethodsA total of 78 palm individuals were collected in the field, from which five chloroplast and two nuclear DNA fragments were sequenced. We reconstructed a Bayesian dated phylogeny and inferred the demographic history. We used a Bayesian phylogeographical spatial diffusion approach to propose a model of colonization. ResultsWe found a phylogeographical break at c. 5 degrees S between two main clades with crown ages of c. 6.7 and 7.3Ma located in the Fitzcarrald Arch (FA) and the subsiding northern Amazonian foreland basin (NAFB), respectively. These diversification times were close to the emergence of the FA in the late Miocene, and the coeval development of the transcontinental modern drainage and sedimentation plain of the NAFB. As expected for the recurrent-dispersal hypothesis, lineage delimitations were spatially inconsistent with the location of rivers or ridges, and we found some evidence of past ancestral population expansion supported particularly by the chloroplast sequences. Main conclusionsOur results support the biogeographical scenario whereby recurrent dispersal into western Amazonia produced spatial isolation of populations, followed by speciation within two areas of contrasting geological activity: tectonic uplift in the FA versus subsidence in the NAFB. We did not test and cannot rule out ecological speciation within western Amazonia or at finer spatial scales."
"AimThe bipolar disjunction, a biogeographical pattern defined by taxa with a distribution at very high latitudes in both hemispheres (>55 degrees N; >52 degrees S), is only known to occur in about 30 vascular plant species. Our aim was to use the bipolar species Carex arctogena to test the four classic hypotheses proposed to explain this exceptional disjunction: convergent evolution, vicariance, mountain-hopping and direct long-distance dispersal. LocationArctic/boreal and temperate latitudes of both hemispheres. MethodsA combination of molecular and bioclimatic data was used to test phylogeographical hypotheses in C.arctogena. Three chloroplast markers (atpF-atpH, matK and rps16) and the nuclear ITS region were sequenced for all species in Carex sections Capituligerae and Longespicatae; Carex rupestris, C.obtusata and Uncinia triquetra were used as outrgroups. Phylogenetic relationships, divergence-time estimates and biogeographical patterns were inferred using maximum likelihood, statistical parsimony and Bayesian inference. ResultsCarex sections Capituligerae and Longespicatae formed a monophyletic group that diverged during the late Miocene. Two main lineages of C.arctogena were inferred. Southern Hemisphere populations of C.arctogena shared the same haplotype as a widespread circumboreal lineage. Bioclimatic data show that Southern and Northern Hemisphere populations currently differ in their ecological regimes. Main conclusionsTwo of the four hypotheses accounting for bipolar disjunctions may be rejected. Our results suggest that direct long-distance dispersal, probably southwards and mediated by birds, best explains the bipolar distribution of C.arctogena."
"AimDisentangling the contributions of niche and dispersal processes as species distribution drivers is crucial from both theoretical and practical standpoints. We investigated whether niche-related and dispersal-related functional traits of 19 beetle clades were good predictors of beta diversity patterns across continental European countries. LocationContinental Europe. MethodsWe quantified the overall compositional heterogeneity (a measure of multiple-site dissimilarity) of each beetle clade in continental Europe and assessed its relationship with body size and the proportion of wingless species as proxies for dispersal ability. Overall compositional heterogeneity was also compared with trophic and habitat preferences of clades as proxiesfor their ecological specialization. Additionally, beta diversity patterns were characterized as a multivariate pairwise dissimilarity matrix among pairs of countries for each beetle clade. We assessed whether differences among these pairwise structures were related to dispersal ability or the ecological specialization of clades. The turnover and nestedness-resultant components of compositional dissimilarity were calculated separately for all analyses. ResultsThe dispersal ability and ecological specialization explained a large proportion (>70%) of the variation in overall compositional heterogeneity but a lower proportion (c. 40%) of the variation in the multivariate pairwise structures. Remarkably, the explained variation was shared between both sets of predictors in the case of overall compositional heterogeneity but was independently related to dispersal ability or ecological specialization for the multivariate pairwise structure analysis. Main conclusionsThese results suggest a tight relationship between ecological specialization, dispersal ability and compositional heterogeneity of European beetle clades. However, the specific patterns of dissimilarities between pairs of countries seem to be determined independently by either ecological or dispersal processes and seem to be subject to other unmeasured factors."
"AimEnvironmental variability can be a major driver of large-scale patterns of distribution and abundance and, within the marine environment, benthic community structure is usually thought to reflect several oceanographic processes and coastal morphological features. The aim of this study was to quantify spatial and temporal variability in large-scale rocky intertidal community structure along the south-east coast of Australia and ask whether these are associated with variation in sea-surface temperatures, chlorophyll-a concentration, heat stress and coastal geomorphology. LocationRocky intertidal shores of south-east Australia spanning > 1750km, 13 degrees of latitude (26 degrees 2423 S to 39 degrees 0747 S) and known biogeographical barriers. MethodsFrom 2009 to 2011 one-thousand and twenty photoquadrats located within the midshore region of 17 rocky shores (20 quadrats site(-1)year(-1)) were used to estimate spatial and temporal variability in the percentage cover of dominant benthic invertebrates and macroalgae. We used satellite data to generate annual estimates of nearshore sea-surface temperatures (SST) and chlorophyll-a concentrations ([Chl-a]) and a meteorological model to estimate heat stress during summer low-tides. ResultsNon-metric multidimensional scaling and cluster analysis revealed a strong and consistent biogeographical break in rocky intertidal community structure between southern and eastern sites. Nearshore oceanographic conditions and summer heat stress did not appear to influence this discontinuity as abundances of functional groups (filter-feeders, grazers and macroalgae) generally did not vary in response to geographical patterns of SST, [Chl-a] or mean daily maximum air temperatures during low-tide. At the species level, however, the distribution and abundance of several species varied with nearshore SST and [Chl-a] including the barnacle Tesseropora rosea and limpets within the genus Patelloida, respectively. Main conclusionsWe found no evidence of strong bottom-up effects on rocky intertidal functional group abundance. This was somewhat expected because bottom-up effects in regions characterized by persistent downwelling are generally weak or non-existent. Instead, broad-scale patterns of community composition were best explained by coastal geomorphology. This study provides an important and necessary comparison for the role of broad-scale environmental variability in structuring marine benthic communities within downwelling rather the more commonly reported upwelling systems."
"AimShifts in the distribution of freshwater algal communities as a result of climate-related limnological changes are well documented; however, impacts on higher trophic levels have received less attention. For example, little is known about how Cladocera (Crustacea, Branchiopoda), often dominant invertebrates and key ecological indicators, have responded to recent warming on broad spatial and temporal scales. Here, we use lake sediment records to test the hypothesis that recent, intensive warming in the western Canadian Arctic has resulted in consistent shifts in the composition of cladoceran assemblages. LocationSmall, first-order lakes in the Mackenzie Delta region of the western Canadian Arctic. MethodsSediment cores representing the recent past (approximately 150-200years) were obtained from five lakes spanning a strong climatic gradient. Subfossil remains of Cladocera were identified and enumerated and overall primary production was inferred using spectroscopic techniques. The habitat preferences and feeding strategy of each taxon were compared. Detrended canonical correspondence analysis was used to estimate compositional turnover since 1850, and compared with that of three cladoceran assemblages from Nova Scotia, to place high-latitude changes in context. ResultsCladoceran assemblage changes occurred coincident with the timing of known regional warming and were strongly linked to estimated changes in primary production. In the northern and deepest lakes, an increase in the planktonic, filter-feeding taxon Bosmina spp. coincided with a decrease in the generalist littoral taxa Chydorus cf. brevilabris and Alona circumfimbriata. In the more southern lakes, an increase in macrophyte-associated scrapers Acroperus harpae and Eurycercus spp. occurred concurrently with decreases in generalist taxa. In one lake, an increase in another specialist, an obligate mud-dwelling taxon, was observed. Main conclusionsIn the western Canadian Arctic, warming has resulted in an increase in cladoceran taxa occupying more specialized feeding and habitat niches. Generalist taxa capable of occupying multiple habitats and employing diverse feeding strategies have been systematically replaced by more specialist species. This response is analogous to what has been inferred for algal communities across the Northern Hemisphere, and represents the first evidence of consistent cladoceran changes to recent climate warming in high-latitude regions."
"AimThe aim of this study was to test the role of environmental factors and spatially autocorrelated processes, such as historical fragmentation and dispersal limitation, in driving floristic variation across seasonally dry tropical forests (SDTFs) in eastern South America. LocationSDTFs extending from the Caatinga phytogeographical domain of north-eastern Brazil to the Chaco phytogeographical domain of northern Argentina, an area referred to as the Dry Diagonal. MethodsWe compiled a database of 282 inventories of woody vegetation in SDTFs from across the Dry Diagonal and combined this with data for 14 environmental variables. We assessed the relative contribution of spatially autocorrelated processes and environmental factors to the floristic turnover among SDTFs across the Dry Diagonal using variation partitioning methods. In addition, we used multivariate analyses to determine which environmental factors were most important in explaining the turnover. ResultsWe found that the environmental factors measured (temperature, precipitation and edaphic conditions) explained 21.3% of the variation in species composition, with 14.1% of this occurring independently of spatial autocorrelation. A spatially structured fraction of 4.2% could not be accounted for by the environmental factors measured. The main axis of compositional variation was significantly correlated with a north-south gradient in temperature regime. At the extreme south of the Dry Diagonal, a cold temperature regime, in which frost occurred, appeared to underlie floristic similarities between chaco woodlands and southern SDTFs. Main conclusionsEnvironmental variables, particularly those related to temperature regime, seem to be the most significant factors affecting variation in species composition of SDTFs. Thus historical fragmentation and isolation alone cannot explain the turnover in species composition within SDTFs, as is often assumed. Compositional and environmental heterogeneity needs to be taken into account both to understand the past distribution of SDTFs and to manage and conserve this key tropical biome."
"Recently, physical geography and landscape ecology have attracted increasing attention, due to the expectation that their theoretical and methodical concepts may improve the assessment of ecosystem services (ES). Examples of promising approaches rooted in various scientific schools, especially of Eastern Europe and Russia. The paper briefly describes these approaches, particularly in terms of ES supply. This is deepened by way of a case study in Russia which shows the crucial role of landscape patterns and landscape units in the assessment of ES with respect to the relationship between forestry and runoff. For the selection of important geosystem-based aspects we started from the ES approach and reviewed the Eastern European (particularly Russian and Eastern German) literature to identify aspects that might be suitable for incorporation into the ES concept. Among the geosystem-based geographical and landscape-ecological approaches which have been addressed by scientific schools in Russia and Eastern Europe, landscape genesis, landscape units, landscape hierarchy, the role of spatial scales, ecosystem patterns and relationships and natural potentials belong to the most promising ones. These approaches can improve assessments of ES by strengthening their scientific foundation, and elaborating them in a spatial context which might help to better influence land use policy and decision-making. Integrated geosystem approaches may provide a number of interesting theoretical and methodological contributions and impulses to the study of ES, especially for the current national TEEB initiatives in many countries. This provides significant perspectives for the application of geosystem-based concepts in ecological planning."
