Around 20 progestins (also called gestagens, progestogens, or progestagens) are used today in assisting a range of medical conditions from endometrial cancer to uterine bleeding and as an important component of oral contraception. These progestins can bind to a wide range of receptors including progestin, estrogen, androgen, glucocorticoid, and mineralocorticoid receptor, as well as sex hormone and corticosteroid binding globulins. It appears that only five of these (four synthetic and one natural) progestins have so far been studied in sewage effluent and surface waters. Analysis has reported values as either nondetects or low nanograms per liter in rivers. Seven of the progestins have been examined for their effects on aquatic vertebrates (fish and frogs). The greatest concern is associated with levonorgestrel, norethisterone, and gestodene and their ability to reduce egg production in fish at levels of 0.81.0 ng/L. The lack of environmental measurements, and some of the contradictions in existing values, however, hampers our ability to make a risk assessment. Only a few nanograms per liter of ethynodiol diacetate and desogestrel in water would be needed for fish to receive a human therapeutic dose for these progestins according to modeled bioconcentration factors. But for the other synthetic progestins levels would need to reach tens or hundreds of nanograms per liter to achieve a therapeutic dose. Nevertheless, the wide range of compounds, diverse receptor targets, and the effect on fish reproduction at sub-nanogram-per-liter levels should prompt further research. The ability to impair female reproduction at very low concentrations makes the progestins arguably the most important pharmaceutical group of concern after ethinylestradiol.

Species-specific endogenous reference sequences are indispensable in the development of methods to detect genetically modified (GM) crops and food/feed. We evaluated and compared the applicability of 6 rice (Oryza sativa) endogenous sequences, including 5 previously reported sequences; SPS1 derived from the sucrose phosphate synthase (SPs) gene, PLD1 and PLD2 derived from the phospholipase D (PLD) gene, GOS9 derived from the root-specific gene gos9, and ppi-PPF derived from the ppi-phosphofructokinase (ppi-PPF) gene, as well as a newly designed sequence, SPS2 in the rice SPS gene promoter region. PCR efficiency and stability were evaluated with 28 rice cultivars, and species specificity was evaluated using gDNAs isolated from major crops and rice-related species. SPS1 and GOS9 were less easy to be amplified and showed lower PCR amplification stabilities than the other sequences among rice cultivars. On the other hand, PLD1 showed high PCR efficiency and stability but low specificity against rice. Meanwhile, ppi-PPF was moderate in all evaluated characteristics. SPS2 and PLD2 showed higher PCR efficiencies and stabilities than those of other sequences, and also had acceptable species specificities. We conclude that SPS2 and PLD2 are ideal endogenous sequences for use in the development of methods to detect and quantify GM rice. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Monoclonal antibodies against epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) are used in the treatment of advanced colorectal cancer. However, these agents can induce severe dermatological side effects that discourage their administration in patients with chronic dermatological disease. EGFR plays a key role in normal skin development and immunological function, and is expressed in various tissues and organs, although contrarily, it is overexpressed in psoriasis-related skin lesions. Thus, discussion is ongoing regarding the putative pathological role and therapeutic potential of this protein. We herein report on a patient with advanced colon cancer and concomitant long-standing psoriasis vulgaris who received anti-EGFR antibody monotherapy as a third-line treatment for metastatic disease. One week after the initiation of treatment, the patient's skin lesions dramatically subsided and the improvement was sustained during therapy. Based on this case, we propose that anti-EGFR antibody therapy is not necessarily contraindicated in patients with psoriasis vulgaris. Moreover, the findings reaffirmed that EGFR is an important molecule in the pathology of psoriasis.

Immunohistochemistry (IHC) is a valuable method for identifying discrete neurochemical molecules by the interaction of target antigens with validated antibodies tagged with a visible label (e.g., peroxidase). We have developed an immunostaining method that is highly sensitive in detection of neurochemical antigens. Our IHC method, which we call the PBTA method, involves a hybrid protocol that implements aspects of both the polymer and avidin-biotin-complex (ABC) methods in combination with biotin-tyramide amplification. When using [Met]-enkephalin as a target antigen, the sensitivity of the PBTA method for IHC was more than 100-fold higher compared with the polymer and ABC methods. In addition, its sensitivity for enzyme linked immunosorbent assay was about 1,000 fold higher compared with the ABC method. We examined the utility of our IHC method for both chromogenic and fluorescence detection systems used to visualize neurochemical peptides and proteins in formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded tissues from autopsied human brains. The results convincingly demonstrate that under optimal conditions, our IHC method is highly sensitive without increasing non-specific background activities. Our IHC method could be a powerful tool for detection and visualization of neurochemical antigens that are present even in trace amounts in autopsied human brains.
