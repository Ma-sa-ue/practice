Regression Tests
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Sequential Taggers
------------------

Add tests for:
  - make sure backoff is being done correctly.
  - make sure ngram taggers don't use previous sentences for context.
  - make sure ngram taggers see 'beginning of the sentence' as a
    unique context
  - make sure regexp tagger's regexps are tried in order
  - train on some simple examples, & make sure that the size & the
    generated models are correct.
  - make sure cutoff works as intended
  - make sure that ngram models only exclude contexts covered by the
    backoff tagger if the backoff tagger gets that context correct at
    *all* locations.
