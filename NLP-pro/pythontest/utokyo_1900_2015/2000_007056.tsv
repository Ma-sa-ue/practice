J	Koyaguchi, T; Kaneko, K				Koyaguchi, T; Kaneko, K			Thermal evolution of silicic magma chambers after basalt replenishments	TRANSACTIONS OF THE ROYAL SOCIETY OF EDINBURGH-EARTH SCIENCES			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	4th Hutton Symoposium on the Origin of Granites and Related Rocks	SEP 20-25, 1999	CLERMONT FERRA, FRANCE			conduction; convection; granite; mass and heat transfer; mush	CONTINENTAL-CRUST; GRANITIC MAGMAS; ERUPTION; JAPAN; FLUID; GENERATION; EXTRACTION; BENEATH; UNZEN	In order to understand the governing factors of petrological features of erupted magmas of island-are or continental volcanoes, thermal fluctuations of subvolcanic silicic magma chambers caused by intermittent basalt replenishments are investigated from the theoretical viewpoint. When basaltic magmas are repeatedly emplaced into continental crust, a long-lived silicic magma chamber may form. A silicic magma chamber within surrounding crust is composed of crystal-melt mixtures with variable melt fractions. We define the region which behaves as a liquid in a mechanical sense ('liquid part') and the region which is in the critical state between liquid and solid states ('mush') collectively as a magma chamber in this study. Such a magma chamber is surrounded by partially molten solid with lower melt fractions. Erupted magmas are considered to be derived from the liquid part. The size of a silicic magma chamber is determined by the long-term balance between heat supply from basalt and heat loss by conduction, while the temperature and the volume of the liquid part fluctuate in response to individual basalt inputs. Thermal evolution of a silicic magma chamber after each basalt input is divided into two stages. In the first stage, the liquid part rapidly propagates within the magma chamber by melting the silicic mush, and its temperature rises above and decays back to the effective fusion temperature of the crystal-melt mixture on a short timescale. In some cases the liquid part no longer exists. In the second stage, the liquid part ceases to propagate and cools slowly by heat conduction on a much longer timescale. The petrological features of the liquid part, such as the amount of unmelted preexisting crystals, depend on the intensity of individual pulses of the basalt heat source and the degree of fractionation during the first stage, as well as the bulk composition of the silicic magma.

All che animals examined were healthy with no fecal abnormality. Twenty-three (22.1%) thermophilic campylobacters, (9 C. jejuni, 11 C. hyointestinalis, 2 C. coli, and 1 C. lari), were isolated from 11 animals (7 mammals and 4 birds). C. jejuni and C. hyointestinalis were the predominant species isolated from these zoo animals and C. hyointestinalis was isolated frequently from simians. As selective media influence the numbers and species of campylobacters isolated, the agar medium was not supplemented with cephalothin. Campylobacters were isolated most frequently when a combination of enrichment culture and selective agar plating was performed at 42 degrees C. For the epidemiological study, a polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-based randomly amplified polymorphic DNA (RAPD) method was used as a tool to detect the heterogeneity of amplified DNAs of Campylobacter spp. isolated from zoo animals. The two arbitrary primers used in this study enabled even closely related strains of the same Campylobacter spp. to be differentiated. RAPD analysis revealed considerable diversity among the strains, suggesting that the transmission of Campylobacter spp. among animals in a defined area occurred through different mechanisms. Examination of the genotypic diversity among the multiple clones from the same host also revealed differences between clones.

To investigate what effects the expression in vivo of FM-MMTV SAg exhibits on the course of the disease in a lupus-prone model, MRL/MpJ-Fas(lprcg)/Fas(lprcg) (MRL-lpr(cg)) mice, neonatally FM-MMTV-infected MRL-lpr(cg)(MMTV) and uninfected MRL-lpr(cg) mice were compared for various disease parameters. In MRL-lpr(cg)(MMTV), survival was significantly prolonged, glomerulonephritis, proteinuria, and lymphadenopathy were clearly ameliorated, and the production of serum immunoglobulin G (IgG), complement-activating IgG(2a), and cryogenic IgG3 autoantibodies, which are thought to be pathogenic to kidneys, and circulating immune complexes (IC), and glomerular IC deposition were significantly suppressed. FM-MMTV infection deleted V beta 8.2(+) cells by about 90% and V beta 14(+) cells less efficiently in all of the CD4(+) CD8(+), and B220(+) CD4(-) CD8(-) or double-negative (DN) T-cell populations, and V beta 8.1(+) cells in the CD4(+) population but not in the others. Similar deletion profiles of CD8(+) and DN T cells support that DN T cells are derived from the CD8 lineage. The results imply that the specific regulation of the immune system with viral SAg has a potential for development of an attractive immunomodulatory therapy of autoimmune diseases.

J	Kurata, A; Franke, FE; Machinami, R; Schulz, A				Kurata, A; Franke, FE; Machinami, R; Schulz, A			Thromboangiitis obliterans: classic and new morphological features	VIRCHOWS ARCHIV-AN INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PATHOLOGY			English	Article						thromboangiitis obliterans; atherosclerosis; thromboembolism; arteritis; pathology	BUERGERS-DISEASE; ISCHEMIA; WOMAN	The clinical and pathological concept of thromboangiitis obliterans (TAO, Buerger's disease) is still controversial. While the clinical criteria of TAO are relatively well defined, the etiology is unknown and its diagnosis based on pathology is confusing, since there is no consensus on the precise pathological criteria for TAO. To investigate the morphological features that differentiate TAO from arteriosclerosis obliterans (ASO) or thromboembolism, and to clarify the morphological independence of TAO, we studied 94 amputated specimens of lower extremities, including 31 specimens from patients with a clinical diagnosis of TAO and 31 autopsy specimens as control cases. It was revealed that most of the classic morphological features described by Buerger and others are not helpful when considered independently in the differential diagnosis, except for intact internal elastic lamina. In addition, findings of intimal inflammation, intact media and absence of medial calcification were demonstrated to be common in both TAO and thromboembolism. Statistical analysis in the present study, the most comprehensive thus far, showed that novel findings of onion-like-shaped recanalizing vessels in the occluded arteries, adventitial fibrosis without medial fibrosis, swelling of the endothelium of the vasa vasorum and edema beneath the external elastic lamina were characteristic of TAO and would be helpful in a differential diagnosis. When a combination of these morphological features is present, diagnosis of a presumed overlap of TAO and ASO in the same site of the vessel concerned is possible. Furthermore, comparison of statistical evaluations based on morphological features per formed in various diagnostic groups implies that the clinical diagnosis of TAO is currently underestimated because the results of the analysis of morphological features of specimens in which TAO was suspected or specimens selected on the basis of a broad and nonspecific definition of TAO were surprisingly similar to the results in strictly defined TAO cases. Our findings suggest that injury and regeneration of minute vessels such as recanalizing vessels and vasa vasorum play a part in the pathogenesis of TAO.

J	Seyama, J; Takeuchi, T; Sato, T				Seyama, J; Takeuchi, T; Sato, T			Tilt dependency of slant aftereffect	VISION RESEARCH			English	Article						slant; tilt; slant aftereffect (SAE); surface; structure-from-motion	ORIENTATION DISPARITY; SURFACE ORIENTATION; LOCAL ORIENTATION; CURVED SURFACES; PERCEPTION; CURVATURE; SHAPE; IMAGES; DEPTH; TEXTURE	Slant aftereffect (SAE), the negative aftereffect of slant induced after prolonged observation of a surface, is considered as evidence that slant is encoded in the visual system. Because slant and tilt are mathematically independent dimensions, Stevens (Stevens, K. A. (1983a). Biological Cybernetics, 46, 183-195) assumed that slant and tilt are processed independently in the Visual system. To confirm this assumption, we investigated whether SAE is induced independently of the difference in tilt between the adapting and test stimuli. The stimuli were displayed by simulating the motion disparity of rotating disks. After adaptation to a surface of 60 degrees slant, the subjective 0 degrees slants of the test stimulus were measured with the tilt differences of 0, 45, 90, 135 and 180 degrees. The magnitude of SAE was greatest when the tilt difference was zero, and decreased with increasing tilt difference. The results suggest that slant and tilt are not processed independently in the visual system and that the slant detector in the visual system is sensitive not only to slant but also to tilt.

With our method, the user can drag a part of a triangular mesh and change its position and orientation. This method is based on an adaptive remeshing procedure that evaluates the deformation of faces by dragging and properly modifies them by deleting or splitting with local topological operations. Therefore, the mesh is automatically adjusted for dragging, and irregularity caused by dragging onto the mesh is no longer a concern. In addition, this method is local to the dragged portion, so its computation is efficient. In this paper we describe our adaptive remeshing method and demonstrate some dragging examples.

J	Komura, T; Shinagawa, Y; Kunii, TL				Komura, T; Shinagawa, Y; Kunii, TL			Creating and retargetting motion by the musculoskeletal human body model	VISUAL COMPUTER			English	Article						human animation; muscle-based model; motion retargetting; motion synthesis	QUADRICEPS MUSCLE; PARAPLEGICS; LOCOMOTION; FATIGUE; GAIT; FES	Recently, optimization has been used in various ways to interpolate or retarget human body motions obtained by motion-capturing systems. However, in such cases, the inner structure of a human body has rarely been taken into account, and hence there have been difficulties in simulating physiological effects such as fatigue or injuries. In this paper, we propose a method to create/retarget human body motions using a musculoskeletal human body model. Using our method, it is possible to create dynamically and physiologically feasible motions. Since a muscle model based on Hill's model is included in our system, it is also possible to retarget the original motion by changing muscular parameters. For example, using the muscle fatigue model. a motion where a human body gradually gets tired can be simulated. By increasing the maximal force exertable by the muscles, or decreasing it to zero, training or displacement effects of muscles can also be simulated. Our method can be used for biomechanically correct inverse kinematics, interpolation of motions, and physiological retargetting of the human body motion.

We analyzed RhDVa and RhDVa-like samples in Japanese blood donors. Materials and Methods: Ten RhDVa samples lacked epD1 and 5 and 3 RhDVa-like variants also lacked, epD2 and a part of 6/7. We identified the full-length nucleotide sequences of the complementary DNA (cDNA) synthesized from 4 samples: 3 of type D-Va and the 4th a D-Va-like variant. Results: Although their sequences differed from each other, all the substitutions were exclusively in exon 5, Three D-Va samples had hybrid RHD-CE(5)-D alleles, but the D-Va-like variant had a unique nucleotide substitution with a single amino acid change, E233K. Exon 5 of the genomic DNA from all 13 samples was analyzed by sequencing. No other sequences were identified. Conclusion: All RhDVa and RhDVa-like variants had the substitution for E233. E233 seems to be a determinant of epD1 and 5. A new category of RhD variant, DYO, was identified. Copyright (C) 2000 S. Karger AG. Basel.

The predicted dynamic biomass profile would be used to quantify biological reactions during settling. The model can be applied by giving easily measurable parameters such as initial MLSS concentration, sludge interface variation which characterizes the settling rate,and SVI as an index of biomass settleability. The model describes the sedimentation process of the sludge by linking three concentrations, namely the MLSS on sludge interface (X-H), constant MLSS on sediment surface (X-C), and the variable MLSS at the bottom (X-B). It was tested for wide ranges of activated sludge concentrations (1750 mg/L-4630 mg/L) and SVI (104-285). The model was applied to express MLSS profile for a full scale SBR as well as for 1 and 2 m column settling tests. The simulated MLSS profile by linking three critical concentrations agrees well with the observed data.

Among them, we applied the FISH (Fluorescent in situ Hybridization) method to analyze activated sludge in wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs). As a result, domain- or division-level community structures in activated-sludge were determined successfully without cultivation. We also applied the PCR (polymerase chain reaction)-DGGE (Denaturing Gradient Gel Electrophoresis) method for laboratory nitrifying sludge in order to investigate more detailed microbial community structure. By this method, genus- or species-level community structures were characterized well. This method was also found to he powerful for monitoring the change of microbial community structures. For example, the behavior of Nitrosomonas group was successfully detected in the reactor with nitrification by the PCR-DGGE method.

By changing five parameters, maximum specific growth rate of nitrifiers, saturation constant of ammonia for nitrifiers, maximum specific hydrolysis rate under anaerobic conditions, maximum specific fermentation rate, and maximum specific polyphosphate accumulation rate of polyphosphate accumulating organisms (PAOs), the process performance was well reproduced by simulation. For the improvement of simulation, inclusion of the formation or presence of soluble COD which is not utilized by PAOs either directly or via fermentation was proposed.

Some marine mammal species from Hong Kong, India, Philippines, Black Sea and North Pacific Ocean were analyzed for comparison. Among the organs and tissues analyzed. concentrations of Sigma BTs (TBT+DBT+MBT) and Sigma Sn were the highest in the liver. Concentrations of Sigma BTs and Sigma Sn in most coastal species were higher than those in offshore species, indicating a greater input of tin compounds in coastal waters. Lower hepatic concentrations of Sigma BTs and ratio of Sigma BTs to Sigma Sn observed in pinnipeds may be attributed to higher metabolic capacity to degrade BTs and to their excretion through hair shedding. Age trends in accumulation of both Sigma BTs and Sigma Sn showed increasing concentrations in immature growth stage and stable levels in mature animals. A significant correlation was observed between the hepatic concentrations of Sigma BTs and Sigma Sn in marine mammals. These findings suggest a significant input and/or bioaccumulation of anthropogenic tin. A significant correlation was found between concentrations of Sigma BTs (as wen as Sigma Sn) in hair and liver of pinnipeds, suggesting that hair can be used as an indicator for monitoring butyltin contamination in the body of pinnipeds under non-killing condition.

In this research, the disinfections of three microorganisms such as bacteriophage alpha beta, E. coli and Cryptosporidium parvum were investigated. An immobilized TiO2 reactor was used and UV lamp and Black light (BL) lamp were used as light source. The intensity of each lamp was set up to equalize the photocatalysis efficiency determined by the decomposition rate of Methylene Blue. The additive effect of TiO2 to inactivation did not appear in the E. coli experiments with UV and BL irradiation or in the alpha beta experiment with UV. In these three cases, light irradiation gave a high germicidal effect and the addition of inactivation by photocatalysis was relatively too small to be significant. In the alpha beta experiment with BL and in he Cryptosporidium experiment with UV and BL, the additive effect by TiO2 could be seen clearly because these microorganisms were resistant to light irradiation in these cases. in spite of setting equal photocatalysis efficiency in both lamp reactors, UV photocatalytic inactivation of Cryptosporidium was much faster than BL. It is assumed that UV and photocatalysis enhanced each other.

In addition to contamination by particular toxicants, complex toxicity due to multi-component chemicals could be much more serious. The environmental situation in bodies of water in Japan led us to apply bioassays for monitoring the water quality of environmental waters in order to express the direct and potential toxicity to human beings and ecosystems rather than determinating concentrations of particular chemicals. However, problems arose from the fact that bioassays for pharmaceutical purposes generally required complicated, time-consuming, expert procedures. Also, a methodology for feedback of the resultant toxicity data to water environment management has not been established yet. To this end, we developed a novel bioassay based on the low-density lipoprotein (LDL) uptake activity of human hepatoblastoma cells. The assay enabled us to directly detect the toxicity of environmental waters within 4 hours of exposure. This is a significantly quick and easy procedure as compared to that of conventional bioassays. The toxicity data for 255 selected chemicals and environmental waters obtained by this method were organized by a mathematical equation in order to make those data much more effectively and practically useful to the management of environmental waters. Our methodology represents a promising example of applying bioassays to monitor environmental water quality and generating potential solutions to the toxicity problems encountered.

Rejection mechanism of arsenic compounds was explained by comparing experimental rejection with calculation of the Extended Nernst-Planck model coupled with steric hindrance model. Nanofiltration membranes of the same material show similar rejection characteristics of arsenic compounds in different species. Steric hindrance and electrostatic effect in the nanofiltration membranes was well described by the model because the rejection of chloride, sulfate and arsenate ions, which exist in ionized forms at a wide pH range showed quite good agreement between model calculation and experimental result. The rejection of dimethyl arsenic acid and arsenite required the consideration of mutual interaction between membrane material and solutes as well as steric hindrance and electrostatic effect. A system with ultra low-pressure nanofiltration membrane coupled with pre-oxidation device was suggested for the treatment of arsenic in groundwater in Bangladesh.

The pilot plant study was conducted by setting a membrane-separation bioreactor (MBR) in a wastewater treatment plant in Tokyo, Japan. A large number of predator organisms were observed in the MBR dominated by ciliated protozoa. The dispersed bacterial size distribution was obtained by using the combination of florescent in situ hybridization (FISH) and image analysis technique. With the increase of predator species especially sessile ciliates and free-swimming ciliates, reduction of smaller bacterial population (1 mum or so) was significant. It was found that, bacteria and predators are negatively correlated i.e. with increasing number of predator organisms the number of dispersed bacteria decreased. This effect of predation was confirmed while observing the floc size distribution with an automatic particle distribution measuring instrument simultaneously. It was observed that when the higher predator organisms (protozoa and metazoa) were high in number, the percentage of flee groups less than 10 mum (optimum prey size for most of the ciliate species) were less and vice versa. From this study it can be concluded that, mainly the smaller flocs which mostly consist of small (<1 <mu>m) dispersed bacterial species, were grazed heavily by the predator population in the membrane-separation activated sludge.

Concentrations of tris(4-chlorophenyl) methane (TCPMe) and tris(4-chlorophenyl)methanol (TCPMOH), which are among the newly identified contaminants, were also determined. Residue pattern was in the order of DDTs greater than or equal to PCBs>CHLs>HCHs>HCB>TCPMOH>TCPMe. Greater DDT concentrations were found in cetaceans from the Japan Sea, coastal waters of Hong Kong and India, indicating serious marine pollution in industrialized Asian nations and current usage of DDTs in tropical regions. In general, cetaceans inhabiting cold and temperate waters contained relatively higher concentrations of PCBs, HCHs, CHLs and HCB as compared with those from tropical regions, reflecting atmospheric transport from the tropical sources to the northern sinks. Latitudinal distribution of TCPMe and TCPMOH in cetaceans from the North Pacific Ocean and Asian coastal waters was similar to that of DDTs, suggesting the less transportable nature of TCPMe and TCPMOH in the marine environment. Penta- and hexa-chlorobiphenyls ware the predominant PCB congeners, accounting for about 70% of the total PCBs. 2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin equivalents (TEQs) of non- and mono-ortho coplanar PCBs in the blubber of cetaceans ranged from 36 (in spinner dolphin from Philippines) to 510pg/g wet wt tin humpbacked dolphin from I-long Kong). Toxic evaluation of coplanar PCBs using TEQ concept indicates an increasing impact on cetaceans from mid-latitudes. Mono-ortho congener IUPAC 118 or non-ortho congener IUPAC 126 was estimated to have the greatest toxicity contribution. The estimated TEQ concentrations in the blubber of some cetacean species exceeded the level associated with immunosuppresion in harbour seals.

PHA behaves as carbon and energy storage material in bacteria. And PHA is a biodegradable plastic when extracted from bacteria. In this paper, the investigations from 3 aspects were reported; control of PHA composition, PHA production under coexistence of nitrogenous compounds, and influence of enrichment condition on PHA productivity. As results, it was possible to regulate PHA composition by utilizing acetate and propionate as carbon source and by regulating its composition. Nitrogenous compounds did not depress PHA productivities in the case of activated sludge, while nitrogenous compounds usually depress in general. PHA contents of MLSS were achieved up to 57% by using anaerobic-aerobic activated sludge. But microaerophilic-aerobic process could supply stably the activated sludge which accumulated PHA with high efficiency.

The membranes were those used for the filtration of raw water taken from the Lake Kitaura, Ibaraki, Japan. Analysis of the molecular weight distribution of extracted foulants by ultrafilters showed that 23% of organic matter was in the fraction exceeding a molecular weight of 100,000 daltons and 33% between 10,000 to 100,000 daltons. Analysis by gel permeation chromatography (GPC) revealed a void peak and five peaks at a molecular weight of less than 6,000 daltons. Assessment by Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) and pyrolysis gas chromatography mass spectrometry (Py-GC-MS) revealed that organic fouling matter contained polysaccharides, proteins, amino sugars and aromatic compounds that constitute humic substances. A comparison of the apparent molecular weight distribution and the FTIR spectra of both the raw water and fouled membrane extracts revealed the attachment of membrane-fouling matter nonexistent in the raw water, which was considered to be extracellular organic matter. Chemical cleaning of fouled membranes suggested that sodium hypochlorite and hydrogen peroxide were effective for the recovery of membrane permeability. In most of the experiments, the higher the cleaning temperature is between 5 degrees C and 40 degrees C, the more effective the chemical cleaning. However, chemical cleaning by a mixture of 1%-NaOCl and 4%-NaOH showed a comparable cleaning efficiency at 5 degrees C as chemical cleaning at 40 degrees% after two hours.

Hollow-fiber UF modules (polyacrylonitrile, MWCO 13,000 daltons, I.D. 0.8 mm, and module length 1126 mm) were used in the experiments. While the permeation flux was controlled at 1.0 m/d, the cross-flow velocity was either fixed at 0.1 m/s or varied as the membrane fouling proceeded. The comparative study on fixed and variable cross-flow velocities revealed that the variable velocity operation was superior to achieve a longer operational period before chemical cleaning. Intensive backwashing was performed when the filtration resistance rose over 10(13) m(-1), which revealed that more than 80% of the resistance was caused by cake-layer that can be removed by the intensive backwashing. However, the operational period was only 54% of the one for the new membranes, which suggested that the percentage reduction of the filtration resistance should not be used as an index of the efficiency of chemical or physical membrane cleaning. Despite shortened operational periods, the intensive backwashing was proposed to be an easy and rapid method to recover the permeability of fouled membranes without chemical use. The cross-flow UF system used in this study was found to be easy to operate even in small water systems in developing countries.

In this study, two different types of pilot scale membrane systems (horizontally and vertically stretched membrane filters) were evaluated based on the effects of pre-chlorination, intermittent chlorination and circulation flow by air-scrubbing. Additionally, the effects of operating factors including physical cleaning and chemical cleaning on membrane fouling were examined. The vertically stretched membranes showed better performance than horizontally stretched membranes at filtration fluxes of either 0.55 m/day or 0.78 m/day even under 2.6 to 27.5 degrees C and raw water turbidity higher than 300 units, as long as intermittent chlorination (10 mg/l once a week) along with the circulation flow by air-scrubbing (once in 30 minutes) in the housing were employed. It was demonstrated that the vertically stretched membranes have been operated for one year without chemical cleaning of the membranes, wherein the recovery of raw water as a filtrate was 97.0% or 98.9%.

As representative processes for the assessment, the most typical and widely used processes were selected. Generally. the life cycle of actual treatment facilities consists of three stages: construction. operation and dismantlement. In this study, the amount of CO2 produced from the life cycle steps of existing unit sludge treatment processes, was calculated by inventory analysis of input materials. In addition, for all processes investigated, individual CO2 emission units (CEUs), i.e. the amount of emitted CO2 for treating a unit weight of sludge, were also calculated. By using the obtained CEU matrix, it was possible to simulate the CO2 production from various types of complex treatment systems as well as to trace the dominant cause of CO2 production in individual treatment processes.

Several field investigations were conducted during settling in different seasons. Nitrate, MLSS, phosphate and TOC profiles were obtained at specified depths. Mass balances of nitrogen were made in order to evaluate the effect of different MLSS and seasonal conditions on nitrogen removal during settling. Total nitrogen reduction of more than 30% was achieved during settling by maintaining high MLSS in order of 3000 mg/L. Residual DO plays an important role in causing delay of denitrification for lower MLSS sludge concentration. Phosphorus release was observed in the bottom of the reactor and its occurrence was well coincident with the pH decrease. Denitrification rates and their temperature dependency were determined. Temperature coefficient theta was found to be 1.083 (valid in the range of 17-27 degrees C). Mass transfer limitation during batch sludge settling was discussed. It was found out from batch tests with and without mixing, that denitrification rate was reduced by 40% under mass transfer limiting conditions.

Biofilms on smooth fiat surfaces such as glass slides grew as isolated cell clusters. Under a hydraulic linear flow velocity of 1.7 cm/s mature biofilms exhibited a network like structure consisting of large interconnected cell clusters leading to possible three-dimensional mass transport. Smooth curved tube surfaces were also colonized by isolated cell clusters. However a clustered structure was not observed in mature tubular biofilms which grew as a continuum. Under laminar flow conditions, the tubular biofilms had a uniform cell distribution along the depth with a flat surface profile. The dense tubular biofilms produced under turbulent flow had a stratified structure with thickness. Morphologically these had an irregular surface profile with protrusions extending from a thick base layer. The production of extracellular polymeric substances were both cell physiology and growth related. While hydrodynamic condition was shown to be an effective tool for manipulation of biofilm structures, the relationship of the structure to biological activity and process control needs further investigation.

A high NH4+-N oxidation Fate of 1.75 kg-N/m(3)/day was achieved with an effective residence time of 15 minutes. The biofilm biomass density increased with increasing load while the density gradient along the filter bed became narrower with higher filtration rate. Specific biological activity was inversely proportional to the biomass density. Specific overall biological activity and specific nitrifying activity were found to be higher towards the effluent end of filters operated at the rates of 20 and 10 m/day whereas the highest specific nitrification activity was found to be at the feed end of the slowest filter. Introduction of easily biodegradable organic substrate affected the nitrification activity in the slower filters. The above findings suggest that the location of concentrated nitrification activity is filtration rate dependent. Presence of nitrifiers close to the feed end in a fixed bed downflow filter could be a disadvantage in the presence of faster growing heterotrophic activity under influent fluctuating conditions.

The community was analyzed by both Fluorescent in Situ Hybridization (FISH) and PCR-DGGE (polymerase chain reaction-denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis) techniques. Five rRNA targeted group specific oligonucleotide probes showed that the alpha- and beta- subclasses of proteobacteria were the most dominant groups among them. The identification of ammonia-oxidizing bacteria in MBR was confirmed by three probes: NEU, Nsv 443 and Nso 190. Mostly the ammonia-oxidizers were found in groups and present in the form of clusters or aggregates. The ratio of NEU/EUB was estimated by double hybridization and image analysis techniques as 6%. The Nitrobacter sp. was also identified inside the MBR with the help of a NIT3 probe and they were also found to be present in the form of a cluster. Usually the clusters formed by the Nitrobacter sp. were smaller than those of ammonia-oxidizing groups. After numerical analysis on the band pattern of DGGE, it was found that the MBR bacterial communities were different from that of conventional activated sludge (CAS) communities with dissimilarity indexes more than 0.6. The diversity of the microbial community was estimated by the Shannon-Weaver index of general diversity. It was found that the value of the diversity index for the CAS process was 1.61 while those for two MBR processes were 1.68 and 1.59.

Experiments were also conducted to identify efficient and effective physical and chemical methods for cleaning the membrane. For both cellulose acetate and PVDF membranes, the effect of algal concentration was found similar. Initially when the deposition was less, the flux was high and the resistance was very low or negligible. As the deposition increased, the resistance increased exponentially. With further increase in deposition, the resistance increases linearly at a constant rate. Among the three pretreatment techniques studied, coagulation with alum and ozonation were effective in controlling the fouling of membrane. Chlorine pretreatment was not effective in reducing the algal cake resistance because it brought about an extensive cell lysis. Photographs taken by Scanning Electron Microscope (SEM) showed damage to the cell surface architecture and release of organic matter to the medium after chlorination. Ozone pretreatment was more effective than chlorine in disintegrating only the extracelluar organic matter (EOM) without causing cell lysis, thus bringing down the algal cake resistance. Cleaning experiments after algal filtration without pre-treatment showed that physical cleaning was less effective than chemical cleaning. All four chemicals tested for membrane cleaning could reduce the cake resistance by more than 99%.

We proposed some new parallel algorithms to mine association rule and generalized association rule with taxonomy and showed that PC cluster can handle large scale mining with them. During development of high performance parallel mining system on PC cluster, we found that heterogeneity is inevitable to take the advantage of rapid progress of PC hardware. However we can not naively apply existing parallel algorithms since they assume homogeneity. We proposed the new dynamic load balancing methods for association rule mining, which works under heterogeneous system. Two strategies, called candidate migration and transaction migration are proposed. Initially first one is invoked. When the load imbalance cannot be resolved with the first method, the second one is employed, which is costly but more effective for strong imbalance.

J	Shibasaki, M				Shibasaki, M			Phorbols: Chemical synthesis and chemical biology	YAKUGAKU ZASSHI-JOURNAL OF THE PHARMACEUTICAL SOCIETY OF JAPAN			Japanese	Review						PKC; phorbol; structure-activity relationship; photoaffinity labeling; inhibitor	PROTEIN-KINASE-C; TUMOR PROMOTERS; ESTER-BINDING; STRUCTURAL BASIS; RATIONAL DESIGN; ACTIVATION; PKC; ANALOGS; DIACYLGLYCEROLS; PHARMACOPHORE	The phorbol esters, such as phorbol 12- myristate 13-acetate (PMA), are known to be powerful tumor promoters and activators of protein kinase C (PKC). First discovered by Nishizuka ct al., PKC is a phospholipid- and calcium-dependent serine/threonine kinase, phisiologically activated by 1,2-diacyl-sn-glycerol (DAG). PRC is also known to be an important target for other structurally diverse tumor promoters such as ingenols, teleocidins, and aplysiatoxins. Structure-activity analyses of a variety of analogs of DAG and these tumor promoters have been carried out. Although many pharmacophore models have been proposed from molecular modeling, no information about specific amino acid residues that interact with these ligands is available. Moreover it has been shown that the biological activity of 11-demethyl-13-deoxyphorbol esters 1, which were synthesized by our group, was not fully consistent with the pharmacophore models so far. Thus, we are now interested in determining the importance of the 13-acetoxy group in phorbol ester-PKC complexes. This has led us to design new photoaffinity probes 66 and 67 and to carry out previously unprecedented photoaffinity labeling of PKC. Photoaffinity labeling of protein kinase C isozymes by both the probes resulted in specific cross-linking. Although the cross-linking yield is not very high, we suppose that determination of the cross-linking site can be realized by taking advantage of subpicomole order analysis by mass spectrometry and other methodologies to clarify the role of individual cysteine rich domain (CRD) in native PKC. We have also designed a new phorbol ester-phosphatidylserine hybrid molecule 69, Because phosphatidylserines in phospholipid membranes are known to have specific interactions with phorbol ester-PKC complexes, such a hybrid molecule can be expected to act as a specific inhibitor of PKC by preventing PKC from interacting with phospholipid membranes. The hybrid molecule was synthesized and preliminary biological activities were examined to inhibit PKC. A catalytic asymmetric synthesis of phorbol PMA is also currently under investigation. Progress is discussed.

The differentiation-inducing activity of various hemin-related compounds suggested certain structural requirements for the activity: 1) the iron moiety of hemin is not essential, and 2) the propionic acid side chains of hemin play an important role in the differntiation and induction. In addition, we have examined the influence of some bioresponse-modifying factors on hemin/protoporphyrin IX-induced differentiation of K562 cell line. Retinoids and tubulin-disruptors, themselves did not induce differentiation, enhanced hemin/protoporphyrin IX-induced differentiation of K562 cells. We also examined the possible involvement of peripheral-type benzodiazepine receptor (PBR) in hemin/protoporphyrin IX-induced differentiation on K562 cell lines. The PER specific ligands modified hemin-induced differentiation. These results suggest a requirement for retinoids (or retinoids-like cofactors) for hemin/protoporphyrin IX-induced differentiation of K562 cells and the involvement of PER in erythroid differentiation of K562 cell line. Further we showed that TPA suppresses hemin-induduced erythroid differentiation of K562 cells, while retinoids augment it. TPA is a potent inducer of heme oxygenase (HO), which catabolizes heme to biliverdin. An HO inhibitor, tin protoporphyrin (SnPP), suppresses TPA-induced K562 cell differentiation to monocytes. It was also found that cotreatment of K562 cells with SnPP and TPA induces erythroid differentiation of K562 cells, though SnPP alone or TPA alone does not induce erythroid differentiation, suggesting a role of HO in the directional switch of differentiation.

Biochem., 102, 69-74 (1987)). In this report we determined the partial amino acid sequence of sarcotoxin III and tried to conduct the cloning of sarcotoxin III cDNA. As a result we obtained two clones coding a protein similar to sarcotoxin III in sequence. Their primary structures are highly homologous to N-terminal sequences of an antibacterial protein from Phormia, diptericin, and another 8 kD antibacterial protein purified from Sarcophaga peregrina. These results suggested that sarcotoxin III is one of the proteins forming a diptericin family in Sarcophaga peregrina as well as newly obtained clone-coded products and 8 kD protein.

J	Yamazaki, T; Yazaki, Y				Yamazaki, T; Yazaki, Y			Molecular basis of cardiac hypertrophy	ZEITSCHRIFT FUR KARDIOLOGIE			English	Review						cardiac hypertrophy; renin-angiotensin system; norepinephrine; cardiac myocyte	PROTEIN-KINASE-C; INDUCED CARDIOMYOCYTE HYPERTROPHY; RENIN-ANGIOTENSIN SYSTEM; VENTRICULAR HYPERTROPHY; GENE-EXPRESSION; ION CHANNELS; RAF-1 KINASE; MYOCYTES; ACTIVATION; PRESSURE	Cardiac hypertrophy is an adaptive process to an increased hemodynamic overload. When cardiomyocytes cultured on silicone dishes were stretched, second messengers such as protein kinase C (PKC), Raf-l kinase, and mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinases were activated, which were followed by increased protein synthesis. Moreover, pretreatment with an angiotensin II (AngII) type 1 receptor antagonist diminished an increase in protein synthesis, MAP kinase activity, and c-fos gene expression induced by the stretching of cardiomyocytes. These suggest the linkage of the cardiac renin-angiotensin system to the formation of pressure-overload hypertrophy. Indeed, in the stretch-conditioned medium the levels of AngII concentration were increased. Also, mechanical stretch enhanced endothelin (ET)-1 release from the cardiomyocytes and activated the Na+/H+ exchanger independently of these vasoactive peptides. In the second part, we examined AngII-induced signaling pathways both in cardiac myocytes and in cardiac fibroblasts. AngII-evoked signal transduction pathways differed between cell types. In cardiac fibroblasts AngII activated MAP kinases through a pathway including the G beta gamma subunit of Gi protein, Src, Shc, Grb2, and Pas, while Gq and PKC activation was necessary in cardiac myocytes. We further explored norepinephrine (NE)induced signaling pathways in cardiac myocytes. NE activated Raf-l kinase and MAP kinases and increased amino acid uptake in cardiomyocytes of neonatal rats. beta-adrenoceptor (AR) stimulation as well as alpha 1-AR stimulation was involved in NE-induced MAP kinase activation. It is noteworthy that unlike in other cell types not only PKC activation but also protein kinase A (PKA) activation increased the activities of Raf-l kinase and MAP kinases in cardiac myocytes and induced cell growth. Finally, we observed that beta-AR-induced activation of MAP kinases is dependent on both Gs/cAMP/PKA and Gi/Src/Ras signaling pathways and that phosphorylation of beta-AR is critical to the cross talk between these signaling pathways.

Chloride cells were detected by immunocytochemistry with an antiserum specific for Na+, K+-ATPase in whole-mount preparations and paraffin sections. Chloride cells first appeared in the yolk-sac membrane in the early embryonic stage, followed by their appearance in the body skin in the late embryonic stage. Immunoreactive chloride cells in the yolk-sac membrane and body skin often formed multicellular complexes, as evidenced by the presence of more than one nucleus. The principal site for chloride cell distribution shifted from the yolk-sac membrane and body skin during embryonic stages to the gill and opercular membrane in larval and later developmental stages. Our observations suggest that killifish embryos and newly-hatched larvae could maintain their ion balance through chloride cells present in the yolk-sac membrane and body skin until branchial and opercular chloride cells become functional.

Seventeen pairs of polymerase chain reaction primers designed for several species of ungulates successfully amplified polymorphic microsatellite DNA in sika deer. About 20% of the Kinkazan population was sampled and genotyped for nine diagnostic microsatellite loci. Alleles at those loci in the Kinkazan population were found to be under the Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium. To determine whether the Kinkazan deer have a reduced level of genetic variability, an average heterozygosity in the population was calculated and compared with the values determined for other populations from Hyogo, Yamaguchi, Shimane, Tsushima, and Nagasaki. Neither the observed nor the expected heterozygosity in the Kinkazan deer significantly differed from that in the other populations. Our result indicated that, despite its small population size, the Kinkazan deer preserve extensive microsatellite variations.

In the ovaries of HPX rats treated with diethylstilbestrol (DES) and pregnant mare serum gonadotropin (PMSG), LH receptor mRNA was expressed in the granulosa cells of mature follicles as well as the theca-interstitial cells. In DES-primed ovaries of rats treated with both GnRH agonist plus PMSG, many follicles were luteinized without ovulation, and the signal of LH receptor mRNA disappeared completely in the theca-interstitial cells as well as the luteinized cells, but remained in the granulosa cells of unaffected mature follicles. The complete suppression of the theca-interstitial LH receptor expression by GnRH agonist was also observed in HPX rats that received no other treatment. On the other hand, the coadministration of a GnRH antagonist with PMSG resulted in the hyperstimulation of follicular growth, accompanied by very strong expression of LH receptor mRNA in the granulosa cells as well as the theca-interstitial cells. In addition, morphological changes in the ovarian interstitial cells were also induced by the administration of GnRH agonist in HPX rats: loose connective tissue decreased and the interstitial cell mass markedly increased. The increase of the interstitial cells became more prominent when rats were treated with GnRH agonist and testosterone simultaneously. These results suggest that GnRH may be an important factor for modulating the interstitial cell function and differentiation in the rat ovary.
