We measured the serum L-PGDS level and compared it with the expressions of the platelet membrane surface glycoprotein and neutrophil adhesion molecule in patients undergoing PTCA. The L-PGDS level significantly decreased (P < 0.01) and the platelet surface expression of CD62P (P-selectin) significantly increased (P < 0.01) immediately after PTCA in the coronary sinus blood. Both changes were inversely correlated (R = -0.72, P < 0.001). Although the L-PGDS level in the coronary sinus blood remained equivalent to the baseline level in patients who experienced restenosis, the level increased over the baseline level (P < 0.01) at 48 h after PTCA in patients without restenosis. Neutrophil surface expression of CD11b (alpha subunit of Mac-1) significantly increased at 24 h (P < 0.01) to 48 h (P < 0.001) after PTCA in the coronary sinus blood in patients with restenosis but the change showed less significant in patients without restenosis. The changes in the L-PGDS level and the CD11b expression at 48 h after PTCA were inversely correlated (R = -0.55, P < 0.05). An increased serum L-PGDS level at 48 h after PTCA possibly predicts the avoidance of late restenosis. It is suggested that reduction in PGD(2) synthesis triggers platelet activation and that a subsequent increase in the PGD(2) synthesis suppresses inflammatory reaction at the intervention site indicated by neutrophil activation and inhibits development of restenosis. Pharmacological or biological intervention that increases endogenous PGD(2) synthesis should be tested as a new strategy to prevent restenosis.

We have reported that a MICA-MICB null haplotype is in linkage disequilibrium with HLA-B*4801 in the Japanese population. In the haplotype, an approximately 100-kb deletion, including the entire MICA gene, was observed and MICB possessed a premature stop codon. In this study, a multiplex polymerase chain reaction (PCR) method was developed for detecting the MICA deletion. MICB alleles were typed by PCR-single-strand conformation polymorphism (SSCP) method and direct sequencing. The frequency of the MICA-MICB arm haplotype was 3.7% on the average, and was strongly associated with HLA-B48 in seven East Asian populations. It was presumed that the stop codon of MICB gene generated after the large-scale deletion. The wide distribution of the null haplotype at polymorphic frequencies suggests that the haplotype has been conservatively maintained because of some selective advantage.

Their composition varied regularly with that of the starting catalyst. The P-containing peroxo species formed was deduced as [PM4O8(O-2)(8)](3-) (M = Mo, W). The peroxo species formed more easily with a decrease in the W content, x of H3PMo12-xWxO40. It was further indicated from the reactivity with cyclohexene and the comparison with catalytic performance that W-rich peroxo species were catalytically more active than Mo-rich peroxo species for the oxidation of cyclohexene in this reaction system.

The paper also presents new kinetic aspects in the catalytic dehydration and dehydrogenation of formic acid on the characterized surface. Switchover of the reaction path from the dehydration to the dehydrogenation occurred by the presence of formic acid undetectable at the surface, where acidic formic acid molecules opened the basic catalysis. In situ STM observation revealed that the dehydrogenation reaction at 400-450 K was strongly suppressed in the vicinity of single-atom height steps. The suppressive effect of step ranged over 2.4 nm into terrace. It is likely that the catalyst with flat surfaces larger than 5 nm is active for the dehydrogenation of formic acid.

Previously, an efficient construction of asymmetric public-key tracing scheme was also presented by Kurosawa and Desmedt, however, their scheme required the involvement of the third trusted party(s) known as agent(s). As far as we know, our scheme is the first concrete construction of a practical asymmetric public-key traitor tracing that does not rely on trusted agents. Moreover, our protocol contains other desirable features: (direct non-repudiation, full frameproof, and black-box traceability for asymmetric scheme) that the previous public-key traitor tracing schemes did not offer. In order to eliminate the dependencies of the trusted agents, we use a novel primitive, recently invented by Naor and Pinkas called, "oblivious polynomial evaluation".

Assuming that the unknown part is a Lipschitz continuous surface, we give a logarithmic conditional stability estimate in determining the part of boundary under reasonably a priori information of an unknown part.

Transportat Res Board			TRAFFIC EQUILIBRIUM PROBLEM; COSTS	Reliability is becoming an increasingly important attribute of road networks. An approach to assess the performance reliability of road networks under nonrecurrent congestion is suggested. Nonrecurrent congestion can arise anywhere along the roadway; when it does arise, it suddenly reduces the capacity of the roadway and makes the traffic condition unstable. Confronted with such uncertain traffic conditions, commuters are known to exhibit different behaviors, namely, risk aversion, risk neutrality, and risk seeking, which are formulated by the expected disutility approach. Commuters are assumed to choose the path with minimal expected disutility. Consequently, a disutility-related multiclass user equilibrium might be achieved when the expected travel disutility between each origin-destination pair can be determined separately and uniquely. Because this disutility implies dissatisfaction or disliking with levels of variations of travel times perceived by commuters, it offers a suitable measure of network reliability for network design. The disutility-related multiclass user equilibrium is formulated as a nonlinear complementarity problem, which is a nonadditive path cost problem and can be solved by recently proposed path-based algorithms. Numerical examples are provided to illustrate the application of the proposed approach.

The liquid nanomeniscus bridges are established between two borosilicate glass spheres of 20 mum in diameter and two kinds of experiment are performed: 1) The pull-off and attracting forces between two glass spheres wetted by OMCTS (Octamethylcyclotetrasiloxane) have been measured as a function of receding and approaching velocity respectively and the pull-off force has been compared with the theoretical value; 2) Normal oscillatory experiment between two glass spheres with meniscus bridge of PFPE (Perfluoropolyether) Zdol has been conducted Results of the experiments are as follows: 1) The measured pull-off or attracting forces show almost constant values at very low receding and approaching velocities. Whereas, the measured forces deviate from the constant value at a higher velocity than 2.70 mum/s because the viscous force may begin to operate. 2) With such small substrates of 20 mum in diameter new dynamic behavior originated from the elastic and damping effects of the liquid meniscus bridge emerges: The elastic components of the system are independent of the modulation frequency representing the characteristic of viscoelastic solid; The system is dominated by the viscous component at high frequency and the elastic component at low frequency. At high frequencies and small separations, the liquid behaves as a Newtonian fluid with a constant viscosity.

J	Kato, T; Soutome, H				Kato, T; Soutome, H			Friction material design for brake pads using database	TRIBOLOGY TRANSACTIONS			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	ASME/STLE Tribology Conference	OCT 01-04, 2000	SEATTLE, WASHINGTON	Soc Tribologists & Lubricat Engineers, ASME		automotive tribology; brakes; tribology database; expert system; statistical analysis	WEAR	Stochastic methods were used for the analysis of test data related to the design of brake pad compositions. The friction and wear test data were analyzed by MRA (Multiple Regression Analysis) and the effect of %volume of the components on the friction and wear characteristics was obtained quantitatively in the form of the standard regression coefficients. The analytical results concerning the effects on component materials on friction and wear characteristics correspond well to the knowledge we have gained though experiences. It was also found that the standard regression coefficients, particularly those for the wear are sensitive to the experimental conditions. This finding corresponds to the lower reproducibility of the results of the wear test. The data were then used to design the composition of brake pads. Optimization was conducted using a GA (Genetic Algorithm). The predicted friction data of the designed brake pads agreed well with the test data. The calculation time is about 1/700 of that by an alternative random search method.

Poor steering ability on tight curves cause severe wear of wheel flange and railhead, and corrugation on the inner rail. The authors proposed active control to improve the steering ability and response to track irregularities. Theoretical analysis was performed to determine control strategies. A full vehicle model was used for calculation and a scale model with a special single-axle bogie was for experiments on running test bench in this study. The test results show that the proposed control method has suitable performance for curving and in track irregularity response.

Study Design-A prospective, randomized study. Animals-Twelve healthy adult beagles (6 males, 6 females). Methods-At least 2 weeks after undergoing permanent tracheostomy, dogs were premedicated with acepromazine-buprenorphine, and anesthesia was induced with thiopental and maintained with alpha -chloralose. The upper airway was functionally isolated so that the inhalant could be administered to the upper airway while dogs were breathing 100% O-2 via the tracheostomy. Respiratory reflexes in response to the administration of sevoflurane or isoflurane at concentrations of 1.2, 1.8, and 2.4 times the minimal alveolar concentration (MAC) (administered in 100% O-2 at a flow rate of 5 L/min) were recorded. Reflexes in response to administration of each anesthetic were also recorded following upper-airway administration of lidocaine. Results-Respiratory reflexes elicited by upper-airway administration of each anesthetic were characterized by a dose-dependent increase in expiration time, with a resultant decrease in respiratory minute ventilation and increase in end-tidal P-CO2. The magnitude of these responses was greater with isoflurane than with sevoflurane at 1.8 and 2.4 MAC. These reflexes were abolished after lidocaine nebulization into the upper airway. Conclusion-Isoflurane induces greater reflex inhibition of breathing than does sevoflurane when the anesthetic is inhaled into the upper airway at concentrations used for mask induction.

Alignment of the predicted amino acid sequences, together with other published sequences from the isolates obtained in other countries, demonstrated a marked heterogeneity among the isolates, confirming the current definition of hypervariable regions within the capsid protein; these regions give rise to the antigenic variations seen in FCV isolates. Phylogenetic analysis of the nucleotide sequences could not identify significant geographically or temporally separated clusters of FCV isolates, supporting the theory of a single genotype.

We address a power optimization method for real-time embedded applications on a variable speed processor. The method combines off-line acid on-line components. The off-line component determines the lowest possible maximum processor speed while guaranteeing deadlines of all tasks. The on-line component dynamically varies the processor speed or bring a processor into a power-down mode to exploit execution time variations and idle intervals. Experimental results show that the proposed method obtains a significant power reduction across several kinds of applications.

Homing mature salmon captured at the mouth of their native stream were used. When neutral (pH 6.7) hatchery water of the same origin as native stream water was allowed to flow through both channels, fish showed active swimming into both channels during a 48 hrs period. When water pH in one channel was lowered by the addition of sulfuric acid, salmon completely ceased upstream swimming behavior into areas of pH lower than 6.0, and swam up into only neutral areas. In the lower pond of the 2-way channels, fish also avoided acidic areas even when average pH was 6.2. Since it has been reported that extremely slight changes in pH such as in the pH 6 range inhibits spawning behavior in this species, it is suggested that land-locked sockeye salmon have a sensitive ability to perceive even slight acidity, and avoid environments which may be deleterious to their offspring.

Three MBRs had been set in a wastewater treatment plant at Tokyo, Japan and they were receiving real wastewater. Initially pH inside the three MBRs was controlled as pH 7, 6 and 5 respectively. Then metazoa population was monitored along with MLSS change. It was found that the presence or absence of the metazoa population did not have any significant effect on the increasing pattern of MLSS. In the MBR with pH 6 highest accumulation of sludge was observed though a high and steady level of metazoa (1,000-2,000 per ml) was present there. But in this MBR a lot of metazoa attached in the membrane was also observed and here the increase in transmembrane pressure was less than in the other two. So, metazoa population especially the attached one in the membrane plays an effective role in fouling control of the membrane. Presence of attached media may provide a suitable niche for metazoa in the process. So, attached media known as DB lace was also inserted in MBRs for testing its capacity along with inoculum of oligochaete worms. Accumulation of sludge was not satisfactory in the attached string and it seems that inoculated worm could not adjust to the environment as they were not sludge originated. So, in the next experimental stage, attached media was inserted in the form of a bundle and this time no inoculation of worm was used. A steady metazoa population was observed in the system but the accumulation of sludge in the attached media was the same as before.

UDC has developed rainwater infiltration technology since 1975. This technology has effectively reduced runoff to a river and sewer system in the new town project areas. Recently, UDC has developed a new system which is defined as a "Rainwater Recycle Sewer System", which is supported by "Rainwater Storage and Infiltration Technology (RSIT)" applicable to new town creation and urban renewal. The new system consists of two elements: RSIT components based on Public-Private Partnership (PPP) and a stormwater drainage system. Herein, the private sector is responsible for the main part of RSIT, and the public sector is responsible for the stormwater drainage from the development area. As a result, the capacity of public facilities, such as rainwater sewers and stormwater reservoirs, can be reduced effectively. In parallel, the initial/running cost of public facilities is expected to be reduced. In conclusion, the authors would stress the importance of a co-maintenance system also based on PPP, which will be required especially in order to properly operate the whole system for the long term.

A synthetic secondary sewage effluent was used as influent in this study, containing both non-biodegradable organic substances (such as humic acid, lignin sulfonate, tannic acid and arabic gum powder) and biodegradable ones. These refractory organic materials were possibly degraded in contact with microorganisms for 20 similar to 27 days. Although humic acid and arabic gum were weakly adsorbed on the activated carbon, they could be effectively removed in the BPAC reactor. The TOC removal at a powdered activated carbon (PAC) concentration of 20 g/L was higher than at 0.5 similar to2 g PAC/L (83% and 66-68%, respectively). The higher removal efficiency was due to the increased rejection at the membrane module in which most of the PAC was accumulated. More than 90% of non-biodegradable compounds removal (detected as E-280, UV absorption at 280 nm) occurred in the BPAC reactor. The biological growth parameter b/Y, used in system design, was estimated to be 0.017 d(-1). Relatively high permeate flux of 1.88 m/d could be obtained even at higher PAC concentration of 20 g/L.

The percentages of antibiotic resistance in the wastewater effluent were, in most cases, higher than the percentages in the river water, which were observed increasing downstream. Since the possible increase in the percentages in the Fiver was associated with treated wastewater discharges, it was concluded that the river, which is contaminated by treated wastewater with many kinds of pollutants, is also contaminated with antibiotic resistant coliform group bacteria and E.coli. The percentages of resistant bacteria in the wastewater treatment plant were mostly observed decreasing during the treatment process. It was also demonstrated that the percentages of resistance in raw sewage are significantly higher than those in the river water and that the wastewater treatment process investigated in this study works against most of resistant bacteria in sewage.

As for FISH, reoptimization of an oligonucleotide probe Nsol 90 was attempted. The advantages and disadvantages of these methods were discussed. MPN appeared to have disadvantages of underestimation. Dot blot hybridization had lower detection limit and higher reliability than other methods. It could be applied to mixed liquors and effluents of municipal wastewater treatment plant (WWTPs), lab-scale reactor and enrichment cultures of ammonia-oxidizing bacteria. FISH could be successfully applied to high ammonium loading system such as enrichment cultures, but weak signal, auto-fluorescence and non-specific binding could cause problems when applied to low ammonium loading systems such as effluents of WWTPs and river water. Mixed liquor of municipal WWTP seemed to be a critical case for FISH.

J	Kazmi, AA; Fujita, M; Furumai, H				Kazmi, AA; Fujita, M; Furumai, H			Modeling effect of remaining nitrate on phosphorus removal in SBR	WATER SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	2nd IWA International Conference on Sequencing Batch Reactor Technology	JUL 10-12, 2000	NARBONNE, FRANCE			activated sludge modeling; biological nutrient removal; endogenous denitrification; reactive settling; sequencing batch reactor	SEQUENCING BATCH REACTOR; NUTRIENT REMOVAL; PLANTS	Nitrate shock loading experiments were conducted in a bench scale SBR to investigate the effect of nitrate on phosphorus removal. After achieving satisfactory phosphorus removal under steady state operation, initial NO3-N concentration amounting to 10 and 20 mg /L was fed at the beginning of the cycle. It was observed that, 10 mg/L of NO3-N suppressed phosphorus release during the feed and mix phases. Organic consumption for denitrification lead to limited PHA storage by phosphorus removing bacteria, resulting in less PO4-P removal. For 20 mg/L, influent organic substrate was not sufficient even for complete denitrification, thus leading to the presence of higher NO3-N and PO4-P in effluent. To explain the dynamics of the nutrient removal system under the transient loading, a SBR model based on IAWQ ASM2 was implemented. After adjusting PHA contents, model simulations well predicted dynamic changes of nitrate and phosphate concentrations during a cycle. Based on the model simulations, competition of COD substrate among denitrification, fermentation and oxygen respiration were investigated by calculating their consumption rates during mixing phase. In addition, a nitrate disappearance model was proposed and implemented in conjunction with a settling model to predict remaining and effluent nitrate in a cycle of SBR. Furthermore, integrated model simulations highlighted the effect of remaining nitrate on phosphorus release considering different options of reactions in settling phase.

Excess sludge wasted from the treatment plants contains organic carbon that could be used as a feasible carbon source for denitrification. However, the excess sludge needs to be hydrolyzed first before being utilized as a carbon source. The objective of this research is to evaluate the biodegradability of the sludge hydrolysate obtained using alkaline, acid, autoclaved and combined solubilization methods. The experimental results suggest that the method of solubilization has an impact on the biodegradability of sludge hydrolysate. Autoclaved alkaline sludge hydrolysate gave the fastest denitrification rate (250 mgN/gMLSSCOD/d) due to fastest protein degradation (247 mgCOD/gLSSCOD/d) and other COD degradation rates (370 mgN/gMLSSCOD/d). Alkaline, autoclaved and acid autoclaved sludge hydrolysates gave nearly the same denitrification rates (185 to 200 mgN/gMLSSCOD/d). Protein degradation rate was the highest for autoclaved alkaline sludge hydrolysate (247 mgCOD/gMLSSCOD/d) whereas carbohydrate degradation rate was the fastest for autoclaved acid sludge hydrolysate (91 mgCOD/gMLSSCOD/d). For the same enzyme activity, different carbohydrate and protein degradation activities have been found suggesting the presence of easily and slowly biodegradable portions in them.

The following four reclaimed wastewater reuse systems and conventional waterworks and sewerage system were evaluated; "Rain water storage and use system", "Onsite wastewater treatment and reuse system", "Sewage treatment and reuse at an intermediate point on the sewer pipe" and "Treated water supply system in sewage treatment plant". In the case that we install them to office and residential buildings, the supplied volume by reclaimed wastewater reuse systems is 693 thousands m(3)/d, this corresponds to 15% of total water demand in the area. Furthermore, the effects of the following scenarios brought about by technological innovation in water treatment were investigated; the case that flush water in toilet and wastewater from kitchen are also available as source in a "onsite wastewater treatment and reuse system" and the case that reclaimed water is used for laundering in residential buildings. When reclaimed water is used for laundering in residential buildings, the supplied volume by these systems increases to 814 thousand m(3)/d in the case that these systems are installed to office and residential buildings.
